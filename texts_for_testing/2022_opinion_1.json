INTRODUCTION\n              The State claimed the right under Revised Statute 2477 (RS 2477) to clear\nland and permit the use of boat launches, camping sites, and day use sites within an\nalleged 100-foot right of way centered on a road on land belonging to an Alaska Native\ncorporation. The Native corporation sued, arguing that its prior aboriginal title prevented\nthe federal government from conveying a right of way to the State or, alternatively, if the\nright of way existed, that construction of boat launches, camping sites, and day use sites\nexceeded its scope.\n              After years of litigation and motion practice the superior court issued two\npartial summary judgment orders. It held as a matter of law that any preexisting\naboriginal title did not disturb the State’s right of way over the land. It also concluded\nas a matter of law that the right of way was limited to ingress and egress. Because the\nsuperior court did not err when it granted the State’s motion regarding aboriginal title,\nwe affirm that grant of partial summary judgment. But because the scope of a particular\nRS 2477 right of way is a question of fact, we reverse its conclusion as a matter of law\nthat the State’s right of way is limited to ingress and egress.\nII.    FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS\n       A.     The Dispute\n              Klutina Lake Road, known locally as the Brenwick-Craig Road, is a single-\nlane dirt road running approximately 25 miles along the Klutina River from Copper\nCenter on the Richardson Highway to the outlet of Klutina Lake. Much of the road\ntravels over land owned by Ahtna, Inc., the regional Alaska Native corporation.1 The\nAhtna Athabascan people have used and occupied the land for hundreds of years.\n\n       1\n              The road also travels over land referred to as Lot 3 and owned by a number\nof private landowners. While those property owners are parties to the underlying\ndispute, they are not involved in this appeal.\n                                            -2-                                       7619\n\f              In 2007 the State cleared a swath of land along the road and removed one\nof the “permit fee stations” Ahtna had erected to collect fees for use of its land. The\nState claimed that it had established a 100-foot wide RS 2477 right of way for the cleared\nland “as early as 1899” and then again in the 1960s when the State “constructed a more\nofficial road.” The State claimed its RS 2477 right of way included a broad scope of\nactivities, such as day use, camping, boat launching, parking, and fishing, as well as the\nright to travel over the road.\n              Ahtna objected to the State’s land clearing and destruction of Ahtna’s\nproperty. It disputed the existence and width of any State right of way, and it argued that\nany right of way that might exist permitted only ingress and egress. In early 2008 Ahtna\nfiled a complaint for declaratory judgment and an injunction regarding the State’s alleged\ntrespass on its land. Years of litigation ensued, culminating in the current appeal.\n       B.     Statutory Background\n              Congress enacted RS 2477 in 1866 as part of the Lode Mining Act.2\nRS 2477 stated in its entirety: “The right of way for the construction of highways over\npublic lands, not reserved for public uses, is hereby granted.”3 The federalgovernment’s\ngrant of rights of way under RS 2477 “was self-executing, meaning that an RS 2477\nright-of-way automatically came into existence ‘if a public highway was established\nacross public land in accordance with the law of Alaska.’ ”4\n\n\n\n       2\n             Lode Mining Act of 1866, ch. 262, § 8, 14 Stat. 251, 253 (codified as 43\nU.S.C. § 932, Revised Statute 2477), repealed by FederalLand Policy and Management\nAct of 1976, Pub. L. No. 94-579, § 706(a), 90 Stat. 2743, 2793 (1976).\n       3\n              43 U.S.C. § 932 (repealed 1976).\n       4\n           Price v. Eastham, 75 P.3d 1051, 1055 (Alaska 2003) (quoting Fitzgerald\nv. Puddicombe, 918 P.2d 1017, 1019 (Alaska 1996)).\n                                            -3-                                        7619\n\f             Congress repealed RS 2477 in 1976 but left existing rights of way intact.5\nIn Alaska, however, authorization for RS 2477 rights of way ended no later than\nJanuary 1969, when the Secretary of the Interior withdrew all public lands not already\nreserved.6 Because the statute was self-executing and did not require rights of way to be\nrecorded, the existence of an RS 2477 right of way is frequently a matter of controversy.7\n             When determining the existence and scope of an RS 2477 right of way over\nNative corporation land, courts must also be mindful of the Alaska Native Claims\nSettlement Act (ANCSA).8 Congress enacted ANCSA in 1971 “to settle all land claims\n\n\n\n      5\n              Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976, Pub. L. No. 94-579,\n§701, 706, 90 Stat. 2743, 2786, 2793 (1976) (“Nothing in this Act, or in any amendment\nmade by this Act, shall be construed as terminating any valid . . . right-of-way . . .\nexisting on the date of approval of this Act.”); Dickson v. State, Dep’t of Nat. Res., 433\nP.3d 1075, 1083 (Alaska 2018).\n      6\n              Public Land Order (PLO) 4582, 34 Fed. Reg. 1025 (Jan. 17, 1969). The\nparties have both cited January 17, 1969, the date Secretary Udall signed PLO 4582, as\nthe date lands were withdrawn. Other sources suggest that the withdrawal was instead\neffective on December 14, 1968, the date the notice of application for withdrawal was\npublished. See Betty J. (Thompson) Bonin, 151 IBLA 16, 26 n.8 (1999) (describing\nDecember 13 as “the earliest date which would not run into the controversy as to when\nthe lands affected by PLO 4582 had been removed from entry and location”); Notice of\nApplication for Withdrawal of Unreserved Lands, 33 Fed. Reg. 18591 (Dec. 14, 1968).\nBecause the parties agree that withdrawalwas effective as of January 1969, and because\nthis case does not require us to determine whether withdrawal was effective sooner, we\ndo not decide whether withdrawal was effective earlier than January 1969.\n      7\n              See S.

Cook Inlet Region, Inc., 807 P.2d 487, 490\n(Alaska 1991).\n                                            -5-                                   7619\n\f              before any Federal or state court or the Indian Claims\n              Commission, are hereby extinguished.[11]\n       C.     Proceedings\n              Ahtna’s 2008 lawsuit sought a declaration that the land in question was\n“free and clear of an RS 2477 [right of way]” and an injunction to prevent the State from\n“further trespass upon Ahtna’s lands.” Ahtna acknowledged that the United States had\na 60-foot-wide easement allowing public travel on the road, but argued that the State did\nnot have an additional 100-foot-wide RS 2477 right of way. The State counterclaimed,\nseeking to quiet title to the claimed right of way and arguing that its RS 2477 right of\nway was superior to the federal one. The parties repeatedly postponed trial in the hope\nof reaching a settlement. In 2014 Ahtna filed a second amended complaint, which forms\nthe basis for the present litigation.\n              In 2016 Ahtna moved for partial summary judgment, seeking a declaration\nthat RS 2477 rights of way permit only ingress and egress. The State opposed. In May\n2016 the superior court granted the motion. The court determined that “RS 2477, which\ngranted rights-of-way for ‘highways over public lands,’ conveyed the right to pass over\nthe land, and nothing more.”\n              Ahtna separately moved for summary judgment “to establish that there is\nno RS 2477 right-of-way along the Klutina Lake Road” because then-existing aboriginal\ntitle prevented conveyance of an RS 2477 right of way. The State opposed. In June\n2018 the superior court denied Ahtna’s motion for summary judgment based on\naboriginal title. The court assumed without deciding that “aboriginal title land was not\npublic land before Congress enacted ANCSA and Ahtna possessed aboriginal title to the\n\n\n\n\n       11\n              43 U.S.C. § 1603.\n                                           -6-                                      7619\n\fland at issue.”12 It then concluded that ANCSA applied retroactively and that ANCSA\nextinguished Ahtna’s aboriginal title.\n              The parties eventually stipulated to entry of final judgment under Alaska\nCivil Rule 54(b). Ahtna stipulated to the existence of a 100-foot RS 2477 right of way,\n“50 feet on each side of the centerline of the current location of Klutina Lake Road,” and\ntwo additional 100-foot RS 2477 rights of way between the Klutina Lake Road and\nKlutina River, subject to its right to appeal on the basis of aboriginal title. Both parties\ndismissed claims, some with prejudice and some without prejudice. However, the parties\n“agree[d] to preserve the right to appeal legal issues already decided . . . on motions for\nsummary judgment.”\n              Ahtna appeals the superior court’s denial of summary judgment concerning\naboriginal title. Ahtna also requests that we confirm the court’s assumption “that the\nAhtna Athabascan people held aboriginal title to the Klutina River Valley.” The State\ncross-appeals the court’s partial summary judgment order declaring that any right of way\npursuant to RS 2477 is limited to the right of ingress and egress.\nIII.   STANDARD OF REVIEW\n              “We review grants of summary judgment de novo.”13 “We review a court’s\ninterpretation of statutes de novo and ‘apply our independent judgment, adoptingthe rule\nof law that is most persuasive in light of precedent, reason, and policy.’ ”14\n\n\n       12\n              This preliminary assumption that the land was not public was significant\nbecause RS 2477 stated: “The right of way for the construction of highways over public\nlands, not reserved for public uses, is hereby granted.” 43 U.S.C. § 932 (emphasis added)\n(repealed 1976).\n       13\n              Christensen v.

DISCUSSION\n      A.     The Superior Court Did Not Err By Denying Ahtna’s Motion For\n             Summary Judgment Based On Aboriginal Title.\n             1.     We need not decide whether the land at issue was public or non­\n                    public as a matter of law.\n             The superior court narrowed the issues by assuming without deciding that\n“aboriginal title land was not public land before Congress enacted ANCSA and Ahtna\npossessed aboriginal title to the land at issue.” On appeal Ahtna urges us to confirm the\nsuperior court’s assumption and explicitly hold that Ahtna possessed aboriginal title to\nthe land surrounding Klutina Lake Road prior to the passage of ANCSA. But such a\ndetermination is not necessary. As discussed below, even if Ahtna did possess aboriginal\ntitle prior to ANCSA, passage of the statute retroactively validated the RS 2477 right of\nway. We therefore decline to decide the issue.15 Like the superior court, we assume\nwithout deciding that Ahtna possessed aboriginal title to the land surrounding Klutina\nLake Road prior to the passage of ANCSA.\n             2.     The superior court’s decision that ANCSA precluded Ahtna’s\n                    aboriginal title arguments is consistent with precedent.\n             The superior court held that aboriginal title did not prevent an RS 2477\nright of way because ANCSA § 4(a) “extinguished aboriginal title as a defense to pre­\n\n      14\n             (...continued)\nF. v. George C., 270 P.3d 737, 746 (Alaska 2012)).\n      15\n               See Paug-Vik, Inc. v. Wards Cove Packing Co., 633 P.2d 1015, 1018\n(Alaska 1981) (affirming trial court’s decision without deciding preliminary issue when\ntrial court found it “unnecessary to reach the complex issues of whether aboriginal title\never existed in Alaska, what criteria must be met in order to acquire aboriginal title,\nwhether the Natives of Naknek in fact met those criteria and whether any title they might\nhave acquired was abandoned”); United States v. Atl. Richfield Co., 612 F.2d 1132, 1134\n(9th Cir. 1980) (“For the purposes of this appeal, we assume that the Inupiats retained\nunrecognized aboriginal title to the North Slope until 1971.”).\n                                           -8-                                      7619\n\fANCSA conveyances of federal land encumbered by aboriginal title at the time of\nconveyance.” Ahtna does not claim that it still possesses aboriginal title over the land\nsurrounding Klutina Lake Road. Instead, it argues that because it had aboriginal title\nwhen the federal government was offering RS 2477 rights of way, the land was not\n“public land” under RS 2477 and was therefore not eligible for an RS 2477 conveyance.\nAhtna argues that because the land was never eligible under RS 2477, there was no\nconveyance, and ANCSA could not have validated a conveyance that did not occur.\n              Ahtna also claims that its argument is not precluded by ANCSA § 4(c),\nwhich extinguishes “[a]ll claims . . . based on claims of aboriginal right, title, use, or\noccupancy of land or water areas in Alaska.”16 According to Ahtna, § 4(c) precludes\nonly claims, not defenses.\n              But we have previously rejected the same arguments. “The stare decisis\ndoctrine rests on a solid bedrock of practicality: ‘no judicial system could do society’s\nwork if it eyed each issue afresh in every case that raised it.’ ”17 Because this case is not\ndistinguishable from our prior cases addressing the same issues, we affirm the superior\ncourt’s order denying Ahtna’s motion for summary judgment based on aboriginal title.\n                     a.      Section 4(a) of ANCSA validated the RS 2477 right of\n                             way.\n              Assuming aboriginal title prevented a conveyance of a valid RS 2477 right\nof way for Klutina Lake Road, the first issue is whether Section 4(a) of ANCSA\nretroactively validated the RS 2477 right of way. Section 4(a) of ANCSA states: “All\nprior conveyances of public land and water areas in Alaska, or any interest therein,\n\n\n       16\n              43 U.S.C. § 1603(c).\n       17\n             Thomas v.

The question of whether ANCSA validated\nconveyances that would otherwise be barred by aboriginal title has already been\nanswered in Paug-Vik, Inc. v. Wards Cove Packing Co.19 In Paug-Vik a cannery sought\nand was granted a declaration confirming its right to use water from Seagull Lake.20\nWards Cove Packing Company claimed that the 1930 appropriation of water by its\npredecessor in interest entitled it to water rights under 43 U.S.C. § 661.21 Paug-Vik, Inc.,\nthe localNative corporation, protested the appropriation, arguing that “prior to ANCSA’s\npassage in 1971 Seagull Lake was used or occupied by the Natives of Naknek, thus\nconferring ‘aboriginal title’ on them and rendering the lake unavailable for appropriation\nby non-natives.”22     When the appropriation was nonetheless granted, Paug-Vik\nappealed.23\n              We started our analysis in Paug-Vik by observingthat “Congress has settled\nthe question of whether conveyances of aboriginal title land under the federal public land\n\n\n       18\n              43 U.S.C. § 1603(a).\n       19\n              633 P.2d 1015 (Alaska 1981).\n       20\n              Id. at 1016.\n       21\n              Id.; see 43 U.S.C. § 661 (concerning recognition of water rights).\n       22\n              Paug-Vik, 633 P.2d at 1017.\n       23\n              Id.\n                                            -10-                                       7619\n\flaws are valid” because “Congress has declared in § 1603(a) of ANCSA that such\nconveyances are effective.”24      After holding that water appropriation rights were\nconveyances covered by ANCSA, we concluded that such conveyances “therefore must\nbe regarded as extinguishing aboriginal title to the same interest.”25 We emphasized that\nour interpretation of ANCSA was consistent with ANCSA’s purpose, “which is that the\nextinguishment provisions of that section should be construed broadly to eliminate every\nclaim resting on the assertion of aboriginal title.”26 Our decision in Paug-Vik is directly\napplicable to this case.\n              Ahtna attempts to distinguish Paug-Vik by arguingthat Paug-Vik addressed\ndifferent statutory language and answered a different question by focusing on “the nature\nof the right acquired by an appropriation of water.” But Ahtna ignores Paug-Vik’s key\nholdings. While the main issue in Paug-Vik was whether the appropriation of water\nrights fell under the umbrella of § 1603(a) conveyances,27 we also held that conveyances\nextinguish aboriginal title under ANCSA § 4(a).28\n              Ahtna’s attempt to distinguish the relevant statutory language is not\npersuasive. The statute at issue in Paug-Vik conveyed a right to water appropriation\n“[w]henever, by priority of possession, rights to the use of water for mining, agricultural,\nmanufacturing, or other purposes, have vested and accrued.”29 There is no reason\n\n\n       24\n              Id. at 1018.\n       25\n              Id. at 1020 (emphasis added).\n       26\n              Id.\n       27\n              Id. at 1018-19.\n       28\n              Id. at 1020.\n       29\n              43 U.S.C. § 661; see Paug-Vik, 633 P.2d at 1017.\n                                            -11-                                       7619\n\fAhtna’s theory — that aboriginal title meant there was no conveyance rather than an\ninvalid conveyance curable by ANCSA — would not have applied in Paug-Vik. If that\ntheory were correct, no conveyance could have occurred in Paug-Vik because aboriginal\ntitle would have prevented water rights from accruing in the first place. As the superior\ncourt observed, Ahtna’s reading of ANCSA § 4(a) “would only extinguish aboriginal\ntitle on land that was not encumbered by aboriginal title. Or, in other words, it would do\nnothing.”\n              Federal cases interpreting ANCSA also support the superior court’s\nholding. In United States v. Atlantic Richfield Co. the Ninth Circuit addressed trespass\nclaims based on aboriginal title. 30     The Ninth Circuit held that ANCSA applied\nretroactively and “extinguished not only the aboriginal titles of all Alaska Natives, but\nalso every claim ‘based on’ aboriginal title in the sense that the past or present existence\nof aboriginal title is an element of the claim.”31 In Edwardsen v. Morton a federal district\ncourt rejected a challenge to pre-ANCSA conveyances despite recognizing that the\nconveyances were “void when granted.”32 As the court explained, “Congress could\nconstitutionally, and did in effect, give the State good title . . . . by removing the only\nimpediment to the validity of the approvals rather than by making a new conveyance of\ntitle.”33 Because its decision was mandated by precedent, the superior court did not err\nwhen it decided that ANCSA § 4(a) retroactively validated the conveyance of an\nRS 2477 right of way for Klutina Lake Road.\n\n\n\n       30\n              612 F.2d 1132, 1134 (9th Cir. 1980).\n       31\n              Id. at 1134 (emphasis added).\n       32\n              369 F. Supp. 1359, 1377 (D.D.C. 1973).\n       33\n              Id. at 1378.\n                                            -12-                                       7619\n\f                     b.     ANCSA does not distinguish between claims anddefenses.\n              Ahtna attempts to distinguish these earlier cases by arguing that ANCSA’s\nlanguage applies only to affirmative claims, not defenses.34 Ahtna points out that\nANCSA § 4(c) refers to “claims” but argues that “[n]o court has ever held that § 4(c)\nprecludes a litigant from defending against an RS 2477 claim on the basis of . . . then­\nunextinguished aboriginal title.” But Paug-Vik made just such an argument when it used\naboriginal title as a defense to a pre-ANCSA conveyance.35 As the superior court noted,\n“[t]here is no meaningful distinction between the circumstances in Paug-Vik and this\ncase.”\n              Ahtna supports its theory by citing Edwardsen, in which the court\ndifferentiated between “challenges to the validity of certain titles to land” and “claims\nfor compensation for alleged trespasses.”36 While it is true that Edwardsen interpreted\nANCSA’s extinguishment of claims more narrowly than Atlantic Richfield, Edwardsen\ndid not distinguish between defensive claims and affirmative claims. Instead, the\nEdwardsen court distinguished between trespass claims and claims based on the loss of\n\n\n\n\n         34\n              Even if we accepted Ahtna’s argument that ANCSA should be read to\nextinguish only affirmative claims and not defenses, that argument would apply only to\n§ 4(b) and § 4(c) of ANCSA. Section 4(a) of ANCSA, through which prior conveyances\nare “regarded as an extinguishment of aboriginal title,” does not refer to “claims” at all.\nThat section would still validate the State’s RS 2477 right of way regardless of whether\n§ 4(c) applied to defenses.\n         35\n            Paug-Vik, Inc. v. Wards Cove Packing Co., 633 P.2d 1015, 1017\n(Alaska 1981).\n         36\n              369 F.

Because Ahtna’s argument that ANCSA extinguishes only affirmative\nclaims has no support in the statute or precedent, the superior court did not err in\nrejecting that argument.\n       B.       It Was Error To Conclude As A Matter Of Law That The Klutina\n                Lake Road RS 2477 Right Of Way Was Limited To Ingress And\n                Egress.\n                The State cross-appeals, arguing that the superior court erred when it held\nthe RS 2477 right of way is inherently “limited to ingress and egress, and cannot, as a\nmatter of law, accommodate activities associated with travel in Alaska such as boat\nlaunching, camping, parking, and day use.” We agree in part: RS 2477 rights of way\nare limited to highway purposes, which are broader in scope than mere “ingress and\negress” but narrower in scope than the State advocates. Because the superior court took\nsuch a narrow view of the RS 2477 right of way’s scope as a matter of law without\nactually considering the factual underpinning of each use the State proposed, we remand\nfor further proceedings about specific uses consistent with the following discussion of\nrelevant law.\n                RS 2477 was self-executing; a “right-of-way automatically came into\nexistence ‘if a public highway was established across public land in accordance with’ ”\n\n\n\n\n       37\n                Id. at 1379.\n       38\n              Id. at 1378 (“In [passing ANCSA], Congress fully intended that there\nshould be no further ‘cloud’ on land titles in Alaska stemming from aboriginal land\nclaims, and that legal challenges to title based on such claims should be barred.”).\n                                            -14-                                        7619\n\fstate law.39 Alaska law recognizes RS 2477 rights of way through two means: “the\npublic must use the land ‘for such a period of time and under such conditions as to prove\nthat the grant has been accepted,’ or appropriate public authorities of the state must act\nin a way that clearly manifests their intention to accept the grant.”40 After considerable\nlitigation the parties in this case stipulated that the Klutina Lake Road is a 100-foot wide\nRS 2477 right of way centered on the roadway.\n              RS 2477 rights of way are limited in scope.41 The full text of the statute\nstated: “The right of way for the construction of highways over public lands, not\nreserved for public uses, is hereby granted.”42 “Highways” granted by RS 2477 are\nrights of ways synonymous with easements, not fee simple interests, and therefore create\nonly a right of use.43 Subject to the limitations inherent in the federal grant of a highway\n\n       39\n              Price v.

The State’s quotation is correct,\nbut Dillingham merely permitted an existing RS 2477 right of way across the servient\nestate to a beach for cargo loading to include access to a new loading dock that did not\nexist when the right of way was established and was not located on the servient estate;\nit does not support expanding the right of way’s scope to include uses other than travel-\nrelated activities.57 In Dillingham we explicitly rejected the argument that an RS 2477\nright of way allowed the government to “use the land for any purpose, such as a park.”58\nAnd although the State is correct that in Dickson v. State, Department of Natural\nResources we disavowed any notion that historic use is relevant once an RS 2477 right\nof way is established, we did not address whether the right of way’s scope included uses\ninconsistent with relevant definitions of “highway.”59\n              Akin to typical right of way easements, where the holder is limited to\nreasonable use of the easement, the holder of an RS 2477 right of way is “authorized to\n\n       55\n              Highway, BLACK’S LAW DICTIONARY (4th ed. 1968) (citations omitted).\n       56\n              Id.\n       57\n              705 P.2d at 414-15.\n       58\n              Id.\n       59\n              433 P.3d 1075, 1084-85 (Alaska 2018) (affirming that RS 2477 right of\nway previously primarily used as part of historic Iditarod trail was not limited to winter\nuse or dog-mushing but could “be used for any purpose consistent with public travel”\n(quoting Dillingham, 705 P.2d at 415)).\n                                           -19-                                          7619\n\fmake any use . . . reasonably necessary for the convenient enjoyment of the easement”60\nsubject to the terms and “purposes for which the servitude was created.”61 The State may\nmaintain and modernize the road, but any expansions must be consistent with the scope\nof the federally granted right of way: as a highway defined and limited by relevant state\nlaw.62        For example, we recently affirmed a superior court’s determination that\nmaintenance activities — such as “grading and compacting the road and plowing snow\nand other debris off the side of the road” — which caused an “[i]ncidental widening” of\na right of way easement did not constitute unreasonable interference with the servient\nestate despite damage to the bordering “trees and brush.”63\n\n\n         60\n               RESTATEMENT (T HIRD) OF P ROPERTY: SERVITUDES § 4.10 cmt. c, at 593\n(AM.

This requires the superior court, within its\ndiscretion, to balance the interests of the servient and dominant estates.64 In light of the\nlength, condition, and purpose of the RS 2477 right of way, some of the State’s proposed\nprojects may more reasonably relate to those factors than others. Projects such as\noccasional pull-outs for travelers to rest or a restroom facility may better fit within the\nscope of a 1969 highway than removing vegetation to provide river views or potential\nfishing sites. A boat ramp at the end of the road, like the dock in Dillingham, may be\nmore reasonable than a series of ramps with associated parking lots along the length of\nthe road. In short, the State must demonstrate that its proposed projects relate to\nfacilitating highway transportation, i.e, that the projects are reasonably necessary for\nhighway purposes as defined in 1969, not simply that the projects would be nice facilities\nalong the highway. And the superior court must use its discretion to determine whether\nthe State’s proposed projects would unreasonably interfere with Ahtna’s reasonable use\nof the land. Because the State has not had an opportunity to present its proposed projects\nto the court and litigate Ahtna’s opposition to those proposed projects, a remand for\nfurther proceedings on this aspect of the dispute is required.\nV.
