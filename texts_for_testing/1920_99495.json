Guthrie,</i> with whom <i>Mr. William L. Marbury</i> was on the briefs, for appellant.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*278</span> MR. JUSTICE BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the court.</p>\n<p>By the Act of August 10, 1917, c. 53, \u00a7 15, 40 Stat. 276, 282, a war measure known as the Lever Act, Congress prohibited the use after September 9, 1917, of food materials or feeds in the production of distilled spirits for beverage purposes and authorized the President to limit or prohibit their use in the production of malt or vinous liquors for beverage purposes, so far as he might, from time to time, deem it essential to assure an adequate supply of food, or deem it helpful in promoting the national security or defense. Under the power so conferred the President, by proclamation of December 8, 1917, 40 Stat. 1728, prohibited the production after January 1, 1918, of any \"malt liquor except ale and porter\" containing more than 2.75 per centum of alcohol by weight. By proclamation of September 16, 1918, 40 Stat. 1848, the prohibition was extended to \"malt liquors, including near beer, for <span class=\"star-pagination\">*279</span> beverage purposes, whether or not such malt liquors contain alcohol\"; and by proclamation of March 4, 1919, 40 Stat. 1937, the prohibition was limited \"to intoxicating malt liquors.\" Under \u00a7 2 of the act the duty of enforcing the above provisions was assigned to the Commissioner of Internal Revenue. This act contained no provision prohibiting the sale of intoxicating or other liquors.</p>\n<p>On November 21, 1918, the so-called War-Time Prohibition Act (c. 212, 40 Stat. 1045) was approved. It provided that:</p>\n<p>\"After May first, nineteen hundred and nineteen, until the conclusion of the present war and thereafter until the termination of demobilization, the date of which shall be determined and proclaimed by the President of the United States, no grains, cereals, fruit or other food product shall be used in the manufacture or production of beer, wine, or other intoxicating malt or vinous liquor for beverage purposes. After June thirtieth, nineteen hundred and nineteen, until the conclusion of the present war and thereafter until the termination of demobilization, the date of which shall be determined and proclaimed by the President of the United States, no beer, wine, or other intoxicating malt or vinous liquor shall be sold for beverage purposes except for export. . . .\"</p>\n<p>On February 6, 1919, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue ruled (Treasury Decision 2788) that a beverage containing as much as one-half of one per centum of alcohol by volume would be regarded as intoxicating within the intent of the Act of November 21, 1918; and that after May 1, 1919, persons would not be permitted to qualify as brewers, if the alcoholic content of their product equalled or exceeded that percentage. In so ruling the Commissioner adopted and applied to this prohibitory act the same classification of malt liquors which had been applied in administering the laws concerning the taxation of beer and other similar fermented liquors. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*280</span> For since 1902 (Treasury Decision 514) fermented liquor containing as much as one-half of one per centum of alcohol had been treated as taxable under Rev. Stats. \u00a7\u00a7 3339 and 3242; and this classification was expressly adopted in the War Revenue Act of October 3, 1917, c. 63, \u00a7 307, 40 Stat. 311. The correctness of this construction of the act was promptly and earnestly controverted by the brewers, who insisted that Congress had intended to prohibit the production only of such beer or other malt liquors as were in fact intoxicating. The attempt was then made to remove the doubt by new legislation before May 1, 1919, when the act would by its terms become operative. On February 26 the House Committee on the Judiciary reported favorably an amendment to H.R. 13581 providing: \"The words `beer, wine or other intoxicating malt or vinous liquors' in the war prohibition act shall be construed to mean any liquors which contain in excess of one-half of one per centum of alcohol.\" The Sixty-fifth Congress ended on March 4 without acting on this bill; and the Sixty-sixth Congress did not convene in Extra Session until May 19. On June 30, the House Committee on the Judiciary reported substantially the same provision as \u00a7 1 of Title I of H.R. 6810; but it was not enacted until October 28, 1919, when as the Volstead Act it was passed over the President's veto.<sup>[a]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*281</span> Immediately after the passage of the Volstead Act, this suit was brought in the District Court of the United States for the Southern District of New York by Jacob Ruppert against Caffey, United States Attorney, and McElligott, Acting Collector of Internal Revenue, to enjoin the enforcement as against the plaintiff of the penalties provided in the War-Time Prohibition Act as amended by the Volstead Act. It was heard below on plaintiff's motion for a preliminary injunction and defendants' motion to dismiss; and having been dismissed, was brought here by direct appeal under \u00a7 238 of the Judicial Code. The bill alleged that plaintiff, the owner of a brewery and appurtenances, was on October 28, 1919, engaged in the manufacture of a beer containing more than one-half of one per centum of alcohol by volume and less than 2.75 per centum by weight or 3.4 per centum by volume, and had then on hand a large quantity of such beer; and that this beer was not in fact intoxicating. Plaintiff contended (1) that the Act of November 21, 1918, had become void or had expired by its own terms before the bill was filed; (2) that its prohibition by its terms was limited to beer which was in fact intoxicating; (3) that the Act of October 28, 1919, Title I, \u00a7 1, which purported to extend the prohibition to the manufacture and sale of beer not in fact intoxicating, exceeded the war power of Congress; and that thereby violation of rights guaranteed to plaintiff by the Fifth Amendment was threatened.</p>\n<p>This case was heard and decided below with <i>Dryfoos</i> v. <i>Edwards, ante,</i> 146; and it was argued here on the same day with that case and <i>Hamilton</i> v. <i>Kentucky Distilleries &amp; Warehouse Co., ante,</i> 146. For the reasons set forth in <span class=\"star-pagination\">*282</span> the opinion in those cases, the Act of November 21, 1918, was and remained valid as against the plaintiff and had not expired. For the same reasons \u00a7 1 of Title I of the Act of October 28, 1919, was not invalid, merely because it was new legislation. But it is insisted that this legislation is nevertheless void as against the plaintiff, because Congress could not, even under its full war powers, prohibit the manufacture and sale of non-intoxicants, and, at all events, could not without making compensation, extend the prohibition to non-intoxicating liquor acquired before the passage of the act. These objections require consideration.</p>\n<p><i>First:</i> May the plaintiff show as a basis for relief that the beer manufactured by it with alcoholic content not greater than 2.75 per centum in weight and 3.4 per centum in volume is not in fact intoxicating? The Government insists that the fact alleged is immaterial since the passage of the Volstead Act by which the prohibition of the manufacture and sale is extended to all beer and other malt liquor containing as much as one-half of one per centum of alcohol by volume.</p>\n<p>If the war power of Congress to effectively prohibit the manufacture and sale of intoxicating liquors in order to promote the Nation's efficiency in men, munitions and supplies is as full and complete as the police power of the States to effectively enforce such prohibition in order to promote the health, safety and morals of the community, it is clear that this provision of the Volstead Act is valid, and has rendered immaterial the question whether plaintiff's beer is intoxicating. For the legislation and decisions of the highest courts of nearly all the States establish that it is deemed impossible to effectively enforce either prohibitory laws or other laws merely regulating the manufacture and sale of intoxicating liquors, if liability or inclusion within the law is made to depend upon the issuable fact whether or not a particular liquor made or sold as a beverage is intoxicating. In other words, it clearly appears <span class=\"star-pagination\">*283</span> that a liquor law, to be capable of effective enforcement must, in the opinion of the legislatures and courts of the several States, be made to apply either to all liquors of the species enumerated, like beer, ale or wine, regardless of the presence or degree of alcoholic content; or if a more general description is used, such as distilled, rectified, spirituous, fermented, malt or brewed liquors, to all liquors within that general description regardless of alcoholic content;<sup>[b]</sup> or to such of these liquors as contain <span class=\"star-pagination\">*284</span> a named percentage of alcohol; and often several such standards are combined so that certain specific and generic liquors are altogether forbidden and such other liquors as contain a given percentage of alcohol.</p>\n<p>A test often used to determine whether a beverage is to be deemed intoxicating within the meaning of the liquor law is whether it contains one-half of one per cent. of alcohol by volume. A survey of the liquor laws of the States reveals that in seventeen States the test is either a list of enumerated beverages without regard to whether they contain any alcohol or the presence of any alcohol in a beverage, regardless of quantity;<sup>[c]</sup> in eighteen States it <span class=\"star-pagination\">*285</span> is the presence of as much as or more than one-half of one per cent. of alcohol;<sup>[d]</sup> in six States, one per cent. of alcohol;<sup>[e]</sup> in one State, the presence of the \"alcoholic principle;<sup>[f]</sup> and in one State, two per cent. of alcohol.<sup>[g]</sup> Thus in <span class=\"star-pagination\">*286</span> forty-two of the forty-eight States \u0097 Maryland appears in two classes above \u0097 a malt liquor containing over two per cent. of alcohol by weight or volume is deemed, for the purpose of regulation or prohibition, intoxicating as a <span class=\"star-pagination\">*287</span> matter of law. Only one State has adopted a test as high as 2.75 per cent. by weight or 3.4 per cent. by volume.<sup>[h]</sup> Only two States permit the question of the intoxicating character of an enumerated liquor to be put in issue.<sup>[i]</sup> In <span class=\"star-pagination\">*288</span> three other States the matter has not been made clear either by decision or legislation.<sup>[j]</sup> The decisions of the courts as well as the action of the legislatures make it clear \u0097 or, at least, furnish ground upon which Congress <span class=\"star-pagination\">*289</span> reasonably might conclude \u0097 that a rigid classification of beverages is an essential of either effective regulation or effective prohibition of intoxicating liquors.<sup>[k]</sup></p>\n<p><i>Purity Extract Co.</i> v. <i>Lynch,</i> 226 U.S. 192, determined that state legislation of this character is valid and set forth <span class=\"star-pagination\">*290</span> with clearness the constitutional ground upon which it rests: \"When a State exerting its recognized authority undertakes to express what it is free to regard as a public evil, it may adopt such measures having reasonable relation to that end as it may deem necessary in order to make <span class=\"star-pagination\">*291</span> its action effective. It does not follow that because a transaction separately considered is innocuous it may not be included in a prohibition the scope of which is regarded as essential in the legislative judgment to accomplish a <span class=\"star-pagination\">*292</span> purpose within the admitted power of the Government.\" (P. 201.) \"It was competent for the legislature of Mississippi to recognize the difficulties besetting the administration of laws aimed at the prevention of traffic in intoxicants. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*293</span> It prohibited, among other things, the sale of `malt liquors.' In thus dealing with a class of beverages which in general are regarded as intoxicating, it was not bound to resort to a discrimination with respect to ingredients and processes of manufacture which, in the endeavor <span class=\"star-pagination\">*294</span> to eliminate innocuous beverages from the condemnation, would facilitate subterfuges and frauds and fetter the enforcement of the law. A contrary conclusion logically pressed would save the nominal power while preventing its effective exercise.\" (P. 204.) \"The State, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*295</span> within the limits we have stated, must decide upon the measures that are needful for the protection of its people, and, having regard to the artifices which are used to promote the sale of intoxicants under the guise of innocent <span class=\"star-pagination\">*296</span> beverages, it would constitute an unwarrantable departure from accepted principle to hold that the prohibition of the sale of all malt liquors, including the beverage in question, was beyond its reserved power.\" (P. 205.)</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*297</span> That the Federal Government would, in attempting to enforce a prohibitory law, be confronted with difficulties similar to those encountered by the States is obvious; and both this experience of the States and the need of the Federal Government of legislation defining intoxicating liquors as was done in the Volstead Act were clearly set forth in the reports of the House Committee on the Judiciary in reporting the bill to the 65th Congress, 3d session, Report 1143, February 26, 1919, and to the 66th Congress, 1st session, Report 91, June 30, 1919. Furthermore, recent experience of the military forces had shown the necessity <span class=\"star-pagination\">*298</span> of fixing a definite alcoholic test for the purpose of administering the limited prohibitory law included in the Selective Service Act of May 18, 1917, c. 15, \u00a7 12, 40 Stat. 76, 82.<sup>[l]</sup> And the Attorney General, calling attention specifically to the claim made in respect to the 2.75 per cent. beer, had pointed out to Congress that definition of intoxicating liquor by fixed standards was essential to effective enforcement of the prohibition law.<sup>[m]</sup> It is therefore <span class=\"star-pagination\">*299</span> clear both that Congress might reasonably have considered some legislative definition of intoxicating liquor to be essential to effective enforcement of prohibition and also that the definition provided by the Volstead Act was not an arbitrary one.</p>\n<p>Plaintiff's argument is equivalent to saying that the war power of Congress to prohibit the manufacture and sale of intoxicating liquors does not extend to the adoption of such means to this end as in its judgment are necessary to the effective administration of the law. The contention appears to be, that since the power to prohibit the manufacture and sale of intoxicating liquors is not expressly granted to Congress, but is a power implied under \u00a7 8 of Article I of the Constitution, which authorizes Congress \"to make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into execution\" powers expressly enumerated, the power to prohibit non-intoxicants would be merely an incident of the power to prohibit intoxicants; and that it cannot be held to exist, because one implied power may not be grafted upon another implied power. This argument is a mere matter of words. The police power of a State over the liquor traffic is not limited to the power to prohibit the sale of intoxicating liquors supported by a separate implied power to prohibit kindred non-intoxicating liquors so far as necessary to make the prohibition of intoxicants effective; it is a single broad power to make such laws, by way of prohibition, as may be required to effectively suppress the traffic in intoxicating liquors. Likewise the implied <span class=\"star-pagination\">*300</span> war power over intoxicating liquors extends to the enactment of laws which will not merely prohibit the sale of intoxicating liquors but will effectually prevent their sale. Furthermore, as stated in <i>Hamilton</i> v. <i>Kentucky Distilleries</i> &amp; <i>Warehouse Co., ante,</i> 156, while discussing the implied power to prohibit the sale of intoxicating liquors: \"When the United States exerts any of the powers conferred upon it by the Constitution, no valid objection can be based upon the fact that such exercise may be attended by the same incidents which attend the exercise by a State of its police power . . .\"</p>\n<p>The distinction sought to be made by plaintiff between the scope or incidents of an express power and those of an implied power has no basis in reason or authority. Thus, the Constitution confers upon Congress the express power \"to establish post offices and post roads\" (Article I, \u00a7 8, clause 7). From this is implied the power to acquire land for post offices in the several States, <i>Battle</i> v. <i>United States,</i> 209 U.S. 36; and as an incident of this implied power to acquire land, the further power is implied to take it by right of eminent domain. <i>Kohl</i> v. <i>United States,</i> 91 U.S. 367. Likewise, the Constitution confers by clause 3 the express power \"to regulate commerce . . . among the several States\"; but there is implied for this purpose also the power to grant to individuals franchises to construct and operate railroads from State to State. <i>California</i> v. <i>Pacific R.R. Co.,</i> 127 U.S. 1, 39. Incidental to this implied power to construct or authorize the construction of a railroad \u0097 is the further implied power to regulate the relations of the railroad with its employees, <i>Second Employers' Liability Cases,</i> 223 U.S. 1, 47; to require safety appliances upon cars, even when used in intrastate commerce, <i>Southern Ry. Co.</i> v. <i>United States,</i> 222 U.S. 20; and to regulate freight rates even to the extent of affecting intrastate rates, <i>American Express Co.</i> v. <i>Caldwell,</i> 244 U.S. 617. Whether it be for purposes of national defense, or for the purpose <span class=\"star-pagination\">*301</span> of establishing post offices and post roads or for the purpose of regulating commerce among the several States Congress has the power \"to make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into execution\" the duty so reposed in the Federal Government. While this is a Government of enumerated powers it has full attributes of sovereignty within the limits of those powers. <i>In re Debs,</i> 158 U.S. 564. Some confusion of thought might perhaps have been avoided, if, instead of distinguishing between powers by the terms express and implied, the terms specific and general had been used. For the power conferred by clause 18 of \u00a7 8 \"to make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into execution\" powers specifically enumerated is also an express power. Since Congress has power to increase war efficiency by prohibiting the liquor traffic, no reason appears why it should be denied the power to make its prohibition effective.</p>\n<p><i>Second:</i> Does the fact that Title I of the Volstead Act took effect upon its passage render \u00a7 1 invalid as against the plaintiff? Prohibition of the manufacture of malt liquors with alcoholic content of one-half of one per cent. or more is permissible only because, in the opinion of Congress, the war emergency demands it. If, in its opinion, the particular emergency demands the immediate discontinuance of the traffic Congress must have the power to require such discontinuance. To limit the power of Congress so that it may require discontinuance only after the lapse of a reasonable time from the passage of the act would seriously restrict it in the exercise of the war powers. Hardship resulting from making an act take effect upon its passage is a frequent incident of permissible legislation; but whether it shall be imposed rests wholly in the discretion of the law-making body. That the prohibition of the manufacture of non-intoxicating beer, if permissible at all, may be made to take effect immediately follows necessarily from the principle acted upon in <i>Mugler</i> v. <i>Kansas,</i> 123 <span class=\"star-pagination\">*302</span> U.S. 623, 669, since the incidents attending the exercise by Congress of the war power to prohibit the liquor traffic are the same as those that attend the States' prohibition under the police power. In the <i>Mugler Case,</i> also, the breweries were erected at a time when the State did not forbid the manufacture of malt liquors; and there it was alleged that the prohibition, which became effective almost immediately, would reduce the value of one of the breweries by three-fourths and would render the other of little value. Here, as there, the loss resulting to the plaintiff from inability to use the property for brewery purposes, is an incident of the peculiar nature of the property and of the war need which, we must assume, demanded that the discontinuance of use be immediate. Plaintiff cannot complain because a discontinuance later would have caused him a smaller loss. This, indeed, appears to be conceded so far as concerns the brewery and appurtenances. The objection on the ground that the prohibition takes effect immediately is confined to the prohibition of the sale of the beer on hand at the time of the passage of the act. But as to that also we cannot say that the action of Congress was unreasonable or arbitrary.</p>\n<p>Plaintiff contends however that even if immediate prohibition of the sale of its non-intoxicating beer is within the war power, this can be legally effected, only provided compensation is made; and it calls attention to the fact that in <i>Barbour</i> v. (<i>Georgia,</i> 249 U.S. 454, 459, following some earlier cases, the question was reserved whether, under the police power, the States could prohibit the sale of liquor acquired before the enactment of the statute. It should, however, be noted that, among the judgments affirmed in the <i>Mugler Case,</i> was one for violation of the act by selling beer acquired before its enactment (see pp. 625, 627); and that it was assumed without discussion that the same rule applied to the brewery and its product (p. 669). But we are not required to determine here the limits <span class=\"star-pagination\">*303</span> in this respect of the police power of the States; nor whether the principle is applicable here under which the Federal Government has been declared to be free from liability to an owner, \"for private property injured or destroyed during war, by the operations of armies in the field, or by measures necessary to their safety and efficiency,\" <i>United States</i> v. <i>Pacific Railroad,</i> 120 U.S. 227, 239; in analogy to that by which States are exempt from liability for the demolition of a house in the path of a conflagration, see <i>Lawton</i> v. <i>Steele,</i> 152 U.S. 133, 136; or for garbage of value taken, <i>Reduction Co.</i> v. <i>Sanitary Works,</i> 199 U.S. 306; <i>Gardner</i> v. <i>Michigan,</i> 199 U.S. 325; or for unwholesome food of value destroyed, <i>North American Storage Co.</i> v. <i>Chicago,</i> 211 U.S. 306; <i>Adams</i> v. <i>Milwaukee,</i> 228 U.S. 572, 584; for the preservation of the public health. Here, as in <i>Hamilton</i> v. <i>Kentucky Distilleries &amp; Warehouse Co., supra</i><i>,</i> there was no appropriation of private property, but merely a lessening of value due to a permissible restriction imposed upon its use.</p>\n<p>It is urged that the act is particularly oppressive in respect to the beer on hand, because the plaintiff was engaged in manufacturing and selling a non-intoxicating beverage expressly authorized by the President in his proclamation of December 8, 1917, and prohibited by him later, only when conservation of all the food products of the country became necessary. The facts afford no basis on which to rest the claim of an equity in the plaintiff's favor. The specific permission from the President to manufacture 2.75 per cent. beer was not on the ground that such beer was non-intoxicating; nor was it a declaration by him that this beer was in fact non-intoxicating. The permission extended to all \"ale and porter\" which, everyone knows, are intoxicating liquors.<sup>[n]</sup> This permission to <span class=\"star-pagination\">*304</span> make 2.75 per cent. beer was withdrawn December 1, 1918, under proclamation of September 16, 1918; and no permission to manufacture specifically 2.75 per cent. beer was ever thereafter given by the President. His later proclamation (March 4, 1919) merely limited the prohibition of the use of foodstuffs to use in the production of \"intoxicating liquors.\" Whether 2.75 per cent. beer was intoxicating was thus left by the President not only without a decision but without even an intimation. The statement of plaintiff that the 2.75 per cent. beer on hand was manufactured under permission of the President is wholly unfounded. It was not until July 1, 1919, when the War-Time Prohibition Act became operative in this respect, that there was any prohibition of the sale of any liquors. So far as appears, all the beer which the plaintiff had on hand at the time of the passage of the Volstead Act was manufactured by the plaintiff long after the President had ceased to have any authority to forbid or to permit.</p>\n<p><i>Decree affirmed.</i></p>\n<p>MR. JUSTICE McREYNOLDS, with whom concurred MR. JUSTICE DAY, and MR. JUSTICE VAN DEVANTER, dissenting.</p>\n<p>I cannot accept either the conclusion announced by the court or the reasons advanced to uphold it. The importance of the principles involved impels a dissent.</p>\n<p>We are not now primarily concerned with the wisdom or validity of general legislation concerning liquors, nor with the intoxicating qualities of beer, nor with measures taken by a State under its inherent and wide general powers to provide for public safety and welfare. Our problem concerns the power of Congress and rights of the citizen after a declaration of war, but when active <span class=\"star-pagination\">*305</span> hostilities have ended and demobilization has been completed.</p>\n<p>The Government freely admits, since the present cause stands upon motion to dismiss a bill which plainly alleges that the beer in question is non-intoxicating, we must accept that allegation as true and beyond controversy. In <i>United States</i> v. <i>Standard Brewery,</i> decided this day, <i>ante,</i> 210, we rule in effect that for many months prior to the Volstead Act, passed October 28, 1919, no law of the United States forbade the production or sale of non-intoxicating malt liquors. And so the question for decision here distinctly presented, is this \u0097 Did Congress have power on October 28, 1919, directly and instantly to prohibit the sale of a non-intoxicating beverage, theretofore lawfully produced and which until then could have been lawfully vended, without making any provision for compensation to the owner?</p>\n<p>The Federal Government has only those powers granted by the Constitution. The Eighteenth Amendment not having become effective, it has no general power to prohibit the manufacture or sale of liquors. But by positive grant Congress has been empowered: \"To declare war,\" \"to raise and support armies,\" \"to provide and maintain a navy,\" \"to make rules for the government and regulation of the land and naval forces,\" \"to make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into execution the foregoing powers\"; and to these it is attempted to trace the asserted power to prohibit sale of complainant's beer. (See concerning implied powers, Cooley's Principles of Constitutional Law, 105; Story on the Constitution, 4th ed., \u00a7 1243.)</p>\n<p>The argument runs \u0097 This court has held in <i>Hamilton</i> v. <i>Kentucky Distilleries &amp; Warehouse Co., ante,</i> 146, that under a power implied because necessary and proper to carry into execution the above named powers relating to war, in October, 1919, Congress could prohibit the sale <span class=\"star-pagination\">*306</span> of intoxicating liquors. In order to make such a prohibition effective the sale of non-intoxicating beer must be forbidden. Wherefore, from the implied power to prohibit intoxicants the further power to prohibit this non-intoxicant must be implied.</p>\n<p>The query at once arises: If all this be true, why may not the second implied power engender a third under which Congress may forbid the planting of barley or hops, the manufacture of bottles or kegs, etc., etc.? The mischievous consequences of such reasoning were long ago pointed out in <i>Kidd</i> v. <i>Pearson,</i> 128 U.S. 1, 21, where, replying to a suggestion that under the expressly granted power to regulate commerce, Congress might control related matters, it was said:</p>\n<p>\"The result would be that Congress would be invested, to the exclusion of the States, with the power to regulate, not only manufactures, but also agriculture, horticulture, stock raising, domestic fisheries, mining \u0097 in short, every branch of human industry. For is there one of them that does not contemplate, more or less clearly, an interstate or foreign market?\"</p>\n<p>For sixty years <i>Ex parte Milligan,</i> 4 Wall. 2, 120, 125, has been regarded as a splendid exemplification of the protection which this court must extend in time of war to rights guaranteed by the Constitution, and also as decisive of its power to ascertain whether actual military necessity justifies interference with such rights. The doctrines then clearly \u0097 I may add, courageously \u0097 announced, conflict with the novel and hurtful theory now promulgated. A few pertinent quotations from the opinion will accentuate the gravity of the present ruling.</p>\n<p>\"Time has proven the discernment of our ancestors; for even these provisions, expressed in such plain English words, that it would seem the ingenuity of man could not evade them, are <i>now,</i> after the lapse of more than seventy years, sought to be avoided. Those great and <span class=\"star-pagination\">*307</span> good men foresaw that troublous times would arise, when rulers and people would become restive under restraint, and seek by sharp and decisive measures to accomplish ends deemed just and proper; and that the principles of constitutional liberty would be in peril, unless established by irrepealable law. The history of the world had taught them that what was done in the past might be attempted in the future. The Constitution of the United States is a law for rulers and people, equally in war and in peace, and covers with the shield of its protection all classes of men, at all times, and under all circumstances. No doctrine, involving more pernicious consequences, was ever invented by the wit of man than that any of its provisions can be suspended during any of the great exigencies of government. Such a doctrine leads directly to anarchy or despotism, but the theory of necessity on which it is based is false; for the government, within the Constitution, has all the powers granted to it, which are necessary to preserve its existence; as has been happily proved by the result of the great effort to throw off its just authority.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>* * * * * * * *</h2>\n<p>\"This nation, as experience has proved, cannot always remain at peace, and has no right to expect that it will always have wise and humane rulers, sincerely attached to the principles of the Constitution. Wicked men, ambitious of power, with hatred of liberty and contempt of law, may fill the place once occupied by Washington and Lincoln; and if this right is conceded, and the calamities of war again befall us, the dangers to human liberty are frightful to contemplate. If our fathers had failed to provide for just such a contingency, they would have been false to the trust reposed in them. They knew \u0097 the history of the world told them \u0097 the nation they were founding, be its existence short or long, would be involved in war; how often or how long continued, human foresight could not tell; and that unlimited power, wherever lodged <span class=\"star-pagination\">*308</span> at such a time, was especially hazardous to freemen. For this, and other equally weighty reasons, they secured the inheritance they had fought to maintain, by incorporating in a written constitution the safeguards which <i>time</i> had proved were essential to its preservation. Not one of these safeguards can the President, or Congress, or the Judiciary disturb, except the one concerning the writ of <i>habeas corpus.</i>\"</p>\n<p>By considering the circumstances existing when the War-Time Prohibition Act was challenged, in order to reach the conclusion announced in <i>Hamilton</i> v. <i>Kentucky Distilleries &amp; Warehouse Co., supra</i><i>,</i> this court asserted its right to determine the relationship between such an enactment and the conduct of war; the decision there really turned upon an appreciation of the facts. And that the implied power to enact such a prohibitive statute does not spring from a mere technical state of war but depends upon some existing necessity directly related to actual warfare, was recognized. Treating that opinion as though it asserted the existence of a general power delegated to Congress to prohibit intoxicants, certain cases which declare our inability to interfere with a State in the exercise of its police power (<i>Purity Extract Co.</i> v. <i>Lynch,</i> 226 U.S. 192; <i>Silz</i> v. <i>Hesterberg,</i> 211 U.S. 31, etc.) are now cited, and it is said they afford authority for upholding the challenged statute. But those cases are essentially different from the present one, both as to facts and applicable principles; the power exercised by the States was inherent, ever present, limited only by the Fourteenth Amendment, and there was no arbitrary application of it; the power of Congress recognized in the <i>Hamilton Case,</i> and here relied upon must be inferred from others expressly granted and should be restricted, as it always has been heretofore, to actual necessities consequent upon war. It can only support a measure directly relating to such necessities and only so long as the relationship continues. Whether these <span class=\"star-pagination\">*309</span> essentials existed when a measure was enacted or challenged, presents a question for the courts; and, accordingly, we must come to this ultimate inquiry: \u0097 Can it be truthfully said, in view of the well-known facts existing on October 28, 1919, that general prohibition immediately after that day of the sale of non-intoxicating beer theretofore lawfully manufactured, could afford any direct and appreciable aid in respect of the war declared against Germany and Austria?</p>\n<p>What were the outstanding circumstances? During the nineteen months \u0097 April, 1917, to November, 1918 \u0097 when active hostilities were being carried on, and for almost a year thereafter, Congress found no exigency requiring it to prohibit sales of non-intoxicating beers. The armistice was signed and actual hostilities terminated November 11, 1918. Our military and naval forces, with very few exceptions, had returned and demobilization had been completed. The production of war material and supplies had ceased long before and huge quantities of those on hand had been sold. The President had solemnly declared, \"The war thus comes to an end; for having accepted these terms of armistice, it will be impossible for the German command to renew it.\" Also \u0097 \"That the object of the war is attained.\" \"The quiet of peace and tranquility of settled hopes has descended upon us.\" July 10, 1919, he announced, \"The war ended in November, eight months ago\"; and in a message dated October 27, 1919, he declared that war emergencies which might have called for prohibition \"have been satisfied in the demobilization of the army and navy.\" Food supplies were abundant, and there is no pretense that the enactment under consideration was intended to preserve them. Finally, the statute itself contains no declaration that prohibition of non-intoxicants was regarded as in any way essential to the proper conduct or conclusion of the war or to restoration of peace.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*310</span> Giving consideration to this state of affairs, I can see no reasonable relationship between the war declared in 1917, or the demobilization following (both of which in essence if not by formal announcement terminated before October, 1919) or restoration of peace (whose quiet had already descended upon us) and destruction of the value of complainant's beverage, solemnly admitted in this record to be non-intoxicating and which it manufactured, held and desired to sell in strict compliance with the laws of New York. Nor can I discover any substantial ground for holding that such destruction could probably aid in an appreciable way the enforcement of any prohibition law then within the competency of Congress to enact. It is not enough merely to assert such a probability; it must arise from the facts.</p>\n<p>Moreover, well settled rights of the individual in harmless property and powers carefully reserved to the States, ought not to be abridged or destroyed by mere argumentation based upon supposed analogies. The Constitution should be interpreted in view of the spirit which pervades it and always with a steadfast purpose to give complete effect to every part according to the true intendment \u0097 none should suffer emasculation by any strained or unnatural construction. And these solemn words we may neither forget nor ignore \u0097 \"Nor shall any person . . . be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation.\" \"The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.\"</p>\n<p>MR.

The term `intoxicating' is too indefinite and uncertain to produce anything like uniform results in such trials. Of course, there are certain liquors so generally known to be intoxicating that any court would take judicial notice of this fact. But in the absence of a definition by Congress there will be innumerable beverages as to which the claim will be made that they do not contain enough alcohol to render them intoxicating. These contentions will produce endless confusion and uncertainty. These, I think, are substantially the reasons why Congress should itself provide a definition.</p>\n<p>\"The importance of this matter has been very much emphasized by our present efforts to enforce the war prohibition act.

Guthrie,</i> with whom <i>Mr. William L. Marbury</i> was on the briefs, for appellant.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*278</span> MR. JUSTICE BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the court.</p>\n<p>By the Act of August 10, 1917, c. 53, \u00a7 15, 40 Stat. 276, 282, a war measure known as the Lever Act, Congress prohibited the use after September 9, 1917, of food materials or feeds in the production of distilled spirits for beverage purposes and authorized the President to limit or prohibit their use in the production of malt or vinous liquors for beverage purposes, so far as he might, from time to time, deem it essential to assure an adequate supply of food, or deem it helpful in promoting the national security or defense. Under the power so conferred the President, by proclamation of December 8, 1917, 40 Stat. 1728, prohibited the production after January 1, 1918, of any \"malt liquor except ale and porter\" containing more than 2.75 per centum of alcohol by weight. By proclamation of September 16, 1918, 40 Stat. 1848, the prohibition was extended to \"malt liquors, including near beer, for <span class=\"star-pagination\">*279</span> beverage purposes, whether or not such malt liquors contain alcohol\"; and by proclamation of March 4, 1919, 40 Stat. 1937, the prohibition was limited \"to intoxicating malt liquors.\" Under \u00a7 2 of the act the duty of enforcing the above provisions was assigned to the Commissioner of Internal Revenue. This act contained no provision prohibiting the sale of intoxicating or other liquors.</p>\n<p>On November 21, 1918, the so-called War-Time Prohibition Act (c. 212, 40 Stat. 1045) was approved. It provided that:</p>\n<p>\"After May first, nineteen hundred and nineteen, until the conclusion of the present war and thereafter until the termination of demobilization, the date of which shall be determined and proclaimed by the President of the United States, no grains, cereals, fruit or other food product shall be used in the manufacture or production of beer, wine, or other intoxicating malt or vinous liquor for beverage purposes. After June thirtieth, nineteen hundred and nineteen, until the conclusion of the present war and thereafter until the termination of demobilization, the date of which shall be determined and proclaimed by the President of the United States, no beer, wine, or other intoxicating malt or vinous liquor shall be sold for beverage purposes except for export. . . .\"</p>\n<p>On February 6, 1919, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue ruled (Treasury Decision 2788) that a beverage containing as much as one-half of one per centum of alcohol by volume would be regarded as intoxicating within the intent of the Act of November 21, 1918; and that after May 1, 1919, persons would not be permitted to qualify as brewers, if the alcoholic content of their product equalled or exceeded that percentage. In so ruling the Commissioner adopted and applied to this prohibitory act the same classification of malt liquors which had been applied in administering the laws concerning the taxation of beer and other similar fermented liquors. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*280</span> For since 1902 (Treasury Decision 514) fermented liquor containing as much as one-half of one per centum of alcohol had been treated as taxable under Rev. Stats. \u00a7\u00a7 3339 and 3242; and this classification was expressly adopted in the War Revenue Act of October 3, 1917, c. 63, \u00a7 307, 40 Stat. 311. The correctness of this construction of the act was promptly and earnestly controverted by the brewers, who insisted that Congress had intended to prohibit the production only of such beer or other malt liquors as were in fact intoxicating. The attempt was then made to remove the doubt by new legislation before May 1, 1919, when the act would by its terms become operative. On February 26 the House Committee on the Judiciary reported favorably an amendment to H.R. 13581 providing: \"The words `beer, wine or other intoxicating malt or vinous liquors' in the war prohibition act shall be construed to mean any liquors which contain in excess of one-half of one per centum of alcohol.\" The Sixty-fifth Congress ended on March 4 without acting on this bill; and the Sixty-sixth Congress did not convene in Extra Session until May 19. On June 30, the House Committee on the Judiciary reported substantially the same provision as \u00a7 1 of Title I of H.R. 6810; but it was not enacted until October 28, 1919, when as the Volstead Act it was passed over the President's veto.<sup>[a]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*281</span> Immediately after the passage of the Volstead Act, this suit was brought in the District Court of the United States for the Southern District of New York by Jacob Ruppert against Caffey, United States Attorney, and McElligott, Acting Collector of Internal Revenue, to enjoin the enforcement as against the plaintiff of the penalties provided in the War-Time Prohibition Act as amended by the Volstead Act. It was heard below on plaintiff's motion for a preliminary injunction and defendants' motion to dismiss; and having been dismissed, was brought here by direct appeal under \u00a7 238 of the Judicial Code. The bill alleged that plaintiff, the owner of a brewery and appurtenances, was on October 28, 1919, engaged in the manufacture of a beer containing more than one-half of one per centum of alcohol by volume and less than 2.75 per centum by weight or 3.4 per centum by volume, and had then on hand a large quantity of such beer; and that this beer was not in fact intoxicating. Plaintiff contended (1) that the Act of November 21, 1918, had become void or had expired by its own terms before the bill was filed; (2) that its prohibition by its terms was limited to beer which was in fact intoxicating; (3) that the Act of October 28, 1919, Title I, \u00a7 1, which purported to extend the prohibition to the manufacture and sale of beer not in fact intoxicating, exceeded the war power of Congress; and that thereby violation of rights guaranteed to plaintiff by the Fifth Amendment was threatened.</p>\n<p>This case was heard and decided below with <i>Dryfoos</i> v. <i>Edwards, ante,</i> 146; and it was argued here on the same day with that case and <i>Hamilton</i> v. <i>Kentucky Distilleries &amp; Warehouse Co., ante,</i> 146. For the reasons set forth in <span class=\"star-pagination\">*282</span> the opinion in those cases, the Act of November 21, 1918, was and remained valid as against the plaintiff and had not expired. For the same reasons \u00a7 1 of Title I of the Act of October 28, 1919, was not invalid, merely because it was new legislation. But it is insisted that this legislation is nevertheless void as against the plaintiff, because Congress could not, even under its full war powers, prohibit the manufacture and sale of non-intoxicants, and, at all events, could not without making compensation, extend the prohibition to non-intoxicating liquor acquired before the passage of the act. These objections require consideration.</p>\n<p><i>First:</i> May the plaintiff show as a basis for relief that the beer manufactured by it with alcoholic content not greater than 2.75 per centum in weight and 3.4 per centum in volume is not in fact intoxicating? The Government insists that the fact alleged is immaterial since the passage of the Volstead Act by which the prohibition of the manufacture and sale is extended to all beer and other malt liquor containing as much as one-half of one per centum of alcohol by volume.</p>\n<p>If the war power of Congress to effectively prohibit the manufacture and sale of intoxicating liquors in order to promote the Nation's efficiency in men, munitions and supplies is as full and complete as the police power of the States to effectively enforce such prohibition in order to promote the health, safety and morals of the community, it is clear that this provision of the Volstead Act is valid, and has rendered immaterial the question whether plaintiff's beer is intoxicating. For the legislation and decisions of the highest courts of nearly all the States establish that it is deemed impossible to effectively enforce either prohibitory laws or other laws merely regulating the manufacture and sale of intoxicating liquors, if liability or inclusion within the law is made to depend upon the issuable fact whether or not a particular liquor made or sold as a beverage is intoxicating. In other words, it clearly appears <span class=\"star-pagination\">*283</span> that a liquor law, to be capable of effective enforcement must, in the opinion of the legislatures and courts of the several States, be made to apply either to all liquors of the species enumerated, like beer, ale or wine, regardless of the presence or degree of alcoholic content; or if a more general description is used, such as distilled, rectified, spirituous, fermented, malt or brewed liquors, to all liquors within that general description regardless of alcoholic content;<sup>[b]</sup> or to such of these liquors as contain <span class=\"star-pagination\">*284</span> a named percentage of alcohol; and often several such standards are combined so that certain specific and generic liquors are altogether forbidden and such other liquors as contain a given percentage of alcohol.</p>\n<p>A test often used to determine whether a beverage is to be deemed intoxicating within the meaning of the liquor law is whether it contains one-half of one per cent. of alcohol by volume. A survey of the liquor laws of the States reveals that in seventeen States the test is either a list of enumerated beverages without regard to whether they contain any alcohol or the presence of any alcohol in a beverage, regardless of quantity;<sup>[c]</sup> in eighteen States it <span class=\"star-pagination\">*285</span> is the presence of as much as or more than one-half of one per cent. of alcohol;<sup>[d]</sup> in six States, one per cent. of alcohol;<sup>[e]</sup> in one State, the presence of the \"alcoholic principle;<sup>[f]</sup> and in one State, two per cent. of alcohol.<sup>[g]</sup> Thus in <span class=\"star-pagination\">*286</span> forty-two of the forty-eight States \u0097 Maryland appears in two classes above \u0097 a malt liquor containing over two per cent. of alcohol by weight or volume is deemed, for the purpose of regulation or prohibition, intoxicating as a <span class=\"star-pagination\">*287</span> matter of law. Only one State has adopted a test as high as 2.75 per cent. by weight or 3.4 per cent. by volume.<sup>[h]</sup> Only two States permit the question of the intoxicating character of an enumerated liquor to be put in issue.<sup>[i]</sup> In <span class=\"star-pagination\">*288</span> three other States the matter has not been made clear either by decision or legislation.<sup>[j]</sup> The decisions of the courts as well as the action of the legislatures make it clear \u0097 or, at least, furnish ground upon which Congress <span class=\"star-pagination\">*289</span> reasonably might conclude \u0097 that a rigid classification of beverages is an essential of either effective regulation or effective prohibition of intoxicating liquors.<sup>[k]</sup></p>\n<p><i>Purity Extract Co.</i> v. <i>Lynch,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"97707\"><a href=\"/opinion/97707/purity-extract-tonic-co-v-lynch/\"><span class=\"volume\">226</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">192</span></a></span>, determined that state legislation of this character is valid and set forth <span class=\"star-pagination\">*290</span> with clearness the constitutional ground upon which it rests: \"When a State exerting its recognized authority undertakes to express what it is free to regard as a public evil, it may adopt such measures having reasonable relation to that end as it may deem necessary in order to make <span class=\"star-pagination\">*291</span> its action effective. It does not follow that because a transaction separately considered is innocuous it may not be included in a prohibition the scope of which is regarded as essential in the legislative judgment to accomplish a <span class=\"star-pagination\">*292</span> purpose within the admitted power of the Government.\" (P. 201.) \"It was competent for the legislature of Mississippi to recognize the difficulties besetting the administration of laws aimed at the prevention of traffic in intoxicants. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*293</span> It prohibited, among other things, the sale of `malt liquors.' In thus dealing with a class of beverages which in general are regarded as intoxicating, it was not bound to resort to a discrimination with respect to ingredients and processes of manufacture which, in the endeavor <span class=\"star-pagination\">*294</span> to eliminate innocuous beverages from the condemnation, would facilitate subterfuges and frauds and fetter the enforcement of the law. A contrary conclusion logically pressed would save the nominal power while preventing its effective exercise.\" (P. 204.) \"The State, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*295</span> within the limits we have stated, must decide upon the measures that are needful for the protection of its people, and, having regard to the artifices which are used to promote the sale of intoxicants under the guise of innocent <span class=\"star-pagination\">*296</span> beverages, it would constitute an unwarrantable departure from accepted principle to hold that the prohibition of the sale of all malt liquors, including the beverage in question, was beyond its reserved power.\" (P. 205.)</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*297</span> That the Federal Government would, in attempting to enforce a prohibitory law, be confronted with difficulties similar to those encountered by the States is obvious; and both this experience of the States and the need of the Federal Government of legislation defining intoxicating liquors as was done in the Volstead Act were clearly set forth in the reports of the House Committee on the Judiciary in reporting the bill to the 65th Congress, 3d session, Report 1143, February 26, 1919, and to the 66th Congress, 1st session, Report 91, June 30, 1919. Furthermore, recent experience of the military forces had shown the necessity <span class=\"star-pagination\">*298</span> of fixing a definite alcoholic test for the purpose of administering the limited prohibitory law included in the Selective Service Act of May 18, 1917, c. 15, \u00a7 12, 40 Stat. 76, 82.<sup>[l]</sup> And the Attorney General, calling attention specifically to the claim made in respect to the 2.75 per cent. beer, had pointed out to Congress that definition of intoxicating liquor by fixed standards was essential to effective enforcement of the prohibition law.<sup>[m]</sup> It is therefore <span class=\"star-pagination\">*299</span> clear both that Congress might reasonably have considered some legislative definition of intoxicating liquor to be essential to effective enforcement of prohibition and also that the definition provided by the Volstead Act was not an arbitrary one.</p>\n<p>Plaintiff's argument is equivalent to saying that the war power of Congress to prohibit the manufacture and sale of intoxicating liquors does not extend to the adoption of such means to this end as in its judgment are necessary to the effective administration of the law. The contention appears to be, that since the power to prohibit the manufacture and sale of intoxicating liquors is not expressly granted to Congress, but is a power implied under \u00a7 8 of Article I of the Constitution, which authorizes Congress \"to make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into execution\" powers expressly enumerated, the power to prohibit non-intoxicants would be merely an incident of the power to prohibit intoxicants; and that it cannot be held to exist, because one implied power may not be grafted upon another implied power. This argument is a mere matter of words. The police power of a State over the liquor traffic is not limited to the power to prohibit the sale of intoxicating liquors supported by a separate implied power to prohibit kindred non-intoxicating liquors so far as necessary to make the prohibition of intoxicants effective; it is a single broad power to make such laws, by way of prohibition, as may be required to effectively suppress the traffic in intoxicating liquors. Likewise the implied <span class=\"star-pagination\">*300</span> war power over intoxicating liquors extends to the enactment of laws which will not merely prohibit the sale of intoxicating liquors but will effectually prevent their sale. Furthermore, as stated in <i>Hamilton</i> v. <i>Kentucky Distilleries</i> &amp; <i>Warehouse Co., ante,</i> 156, while discussing the implied power to prohibit the sale of intoxicating liquors: \"When the United States exerts any of the powers conferred upon it by the Constitution, no valid objection can be based upon the fact that such exercise may be attended by the same incidents which attend the exercise by a State of its police power . . .\"</p>\n<p>The distinction sought to be made by plaintiff between the scope or incidents of an express power and those of an implied power has no basis in reason or authority. Thus, the Constitution confers upon Congress the express power \"to establish post offices and post roads\" (Article I, \u00a7 8, clause 7). From this is implied the power to acquire land for post offices in the several States, <i>Battle</i> v. <i>United States,</i> 209 U.S. 36; and as an incident of this implied power to acquire land, the further power is implied to take it by right of eminent domain. <i>Kohl</i> v. <i>United States,</i> 91 U.S. 367. Likewise, the Constitution confers by clause 3 the express power \"to regulate commerce . . . among the several States\"; but there is implied for this purpose also the power to grant to individuals franchises to construct and operate railroads from State to State. <i>California</i> v. <i>Pacific R.R. Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"92223\"><a href=\"/opinion/92223/california-v-central-pacific-r-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">127</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 39. Incidental to this implied power to construct or authorize the construction of a railroad \u0097 is the further implied power to regulate the relations of the railroad with its employees, <i>Second Employers' Liability Cases,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2620807\"><a href=\"/opinion/2620807/second-employersliability-cases/\"><span class=\"volume\">223</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 47; to require safety appliances upon cars, even when used in intrastate commerce, <i>Southern Ry. Co.</i> v. <i>United States,</i> 222 U.S. 20; and to regulate freight rates even to the extent of affecting intrastate rates, <i>American Express Co.</i> v. <i>Caldwell,</i> 244 U.S. 617. Whether it be for purposes of national defense, or for the purpose <span class=\"star-pagination\">*301</span> of establishing post offices and post roads or for the purpose of regulating commerce among the several States Congress has the power \"to make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into execution\" the duty so reposed in the Federal Government. While this is a Government of enumerated powers it has full attributes of sovereignty within the limits of those powers. <i>In re Debs,</i> 158 U.S. 564. Some confusion of thought might perhaps have been avoided, if, instead of distinguishing between powers by the terms express and implied, the terms specific and general had been used. For the power conferred by clause 18 of \u00a7 8 \"to make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into execution\" powers specifically enumerated is also an express power. Since Congress has power to increase war efficiency by prohibiting the liquor traffic, no reason appears why it should be denied the power to make its prohibition effective.</p>\n<p><i>Second:</i> Does the fact that Title I of the Volstead Act took effect upon its passage render \u00a7 1 invalid as against the plaintiff? Prohibition of the manufacture of malt liquors with alcoholic content of one-half of one per cent. or more is permissible only because, in the opinion of Congress, the war emergency demands it. If, in its opinion, the particular emergency demands the immediate discontinuance of the traffic Congress must have the power to require such discontinuance. To limit the power of Congress so that it may require discontinuance only after the lapse of a reasonable time from the passage of the act would seriously restrict it in the exercise of the war powers. Hardship resulting from making an act take effect upon its passage is a frequent incident of permissible legislation; but whether it shall be imposed rests wholly in the discretion of the law-making body. That the prohibition of the manufacture of non-intoxicating beer, if permissible at all, may be made to take effect immediately follows necessarily from the principle acted upon in <i>Mugler</i> v. <i>Kansas,</i> 123 <span class=\"star-pagination\">*302</span> U.S. 623, 669, since the incidents attending the exercise by Congress of the war power to prohibit the liquor traffic are the same as those that attend the States' prohibition under the police power. In the <i>Mugler Case,</i> also, the breweries were erected at a time when the State did not forbid the manufacture of malt liquors; and there it was alleged that the prohibition, which became effective almost immediately, would reduce the value of one of the breweries by three-fourths and would render the other of little value. Here, as there, the loss resulting to the plaintiff from inability to use the property for brewery purposes, is an incident of the peculiar nature of the property and of the war need which, we must assume, demanded that the discontinuance of use be immediate. Plaintiff cannot complain because a discontinuance later would have caused him a smaller loss. This, indeed, appears to be conceded so far as concerns the brewery and appurtenances. The objection on the ground that the prohibition takes effect immediately is confined to the prohibition of the sale of the beer on hand at the time of the passage of the act. But as to that also we cannot say that the action of Congress was unreasonable or arbitrary.</p>\n<p>Plaintiff contends however that even if immediate prohibition of the sale of its non-intoxicating beer is within the war power, this can be legally effected, only provided compensation is made; and it calls attention to the fact that in <i>Barbour</i> v. (<i>Georgia,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"99358\"><a href=\"/opinion/99358/barbour-v-georgia/\"><span class=\"volume\">249</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">454</span></a></span>, 459, following some earlier cases, the question was reserved whether, under the police power, the States could prohibit the sale of liquor acquired before the enactment of the statute. It should, however, be noted that, among the judgments affirmed in the <i>Mugler Case,</i> was one for violation of the act by selling beer acquired before its enactment (see pp. 625, 627); and that it was assumed without discussion that the same rule applied to the brewery and its product (p. 669). But we are not required to determine here the limits <span class=\"star-pagination\">*303</span> in this respect of the police power of the States; nor whether the principle is applicable here under which the Federal Government has been declared to be free from liability to an owner, \"for private property injured or destroyed during war, by the operations of armies in the field, or by measures necessary to their safety and efficiency,\" <i>United States</i> v. <i>Pacific Railroad,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"91841\"><a href=\"/opinion/91841/united-states-v-pacific-r-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">120</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">227</span></a></span>, 239; in analogy to that by which States are exempt from liability for the demolition of a house in the path of a conflagration, see <i>Lawton</i> v. <i>Steele,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"93817\"><a href=\"/opinion/93817/lawton-v-steele/\"><span class=\"volume\">152</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">133</span></a></span>, 136; or for garbage of value taken, <i>Reduction Co.</i> v. <i>Sanitary Works,</i> 199 U.S. 306; <i>Gardner</i> v. <i>Michigan,</i> 199 U.S. 325; or for unwholesome food of value destroyed, <i>North American Storage Co.</i> v. <i>Chicago,</i> 211 U.S. 306; <i>Adams</i> v. <i>Milwaukee,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"97875\"><a href=\"/opinion/97875/adams-v-milwaukee/\"><span class=\"volume\">228</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">572</span></a></span>, 584; for the preservation of the public health. Here, as in <i>Hamilton</i> v. <i>Kentucky Distilleries &amp; Warehouse Co., supra</i><i>,</i> there was no appropriation of private property, but merely a lessening of value due to a permissible restriction imposed upon its use.</p>\n<p>It is urged that the act is particularly oppressive in respect to the beer on hand, because the plaintiff was engaged in manufacturing and selling a non-intoxicating beverage expressly authorized by the President in his proclamation of December 8, 1917, and prohibited by him later, only when conservation of all the food products of the country became necessary. The facts afford no basis on which to rest the claim of an equity in the plaintiff's favor. The specific permission from the President to manufacture 2.75 per cent. beer was not on the ground that such beer was non-intoxicating; nor was it a declaration by him that this beer was in fact non-intoxicating. The permission extended to all \"ale and porter\" which, everyone knows, are intoxicating liquors.<sup>[n]</sup> This permission to <span class=\"star-pagination\">*304</span> make 2.75 per cent. beer was withdrawn December 1, 1918, under proclamation of September 16, 1918; and no permission to manufacture specifically 2.75 per cent. beer was ever thereafter given by the President. His later proclamation (March 4, 1919) merely limited the prohibition of the use of foodstuffs to use in the production of \"intoxicating liquors.\" Whether 2.75 per cent. beer was intoxicating was thus left by the President not only without a decision but without even an intimation. The statement of plaintiff that the 2.75 per cent. beer on hand was manufactured under permission of the President is wholly unfounded. It was not until July 1, 1919, when the War-Time Prohibition Act became operative in this respect, that there was any prohibition of the sale of any liquors. So far as appears, all the beer which the plaintiff had on hand at the time of the passage of the Volstead Act was manufactured by the plaintiff long after the President had ceased to have any authority to forbid or to permit.</p>\n<p><i>Decree affirmed.</i></p>\n<p>MR. JUSTICE McREYNOLDS, with whom concurred MR. JUSTICE DAY, and MR. JUSTICE VAN DEVANTER, dissenting.</p>\n<p>I cannot accept either the conclusion announced by the court or the reasons advanced to uphold it. The importance of the principles involved impels a dissent.</p>\n<p>We are not now primarily concerned with the wisdom or validity of general legislation concerning liquors, nor with the intoxicating qualities of beer, nor with measures taken by a State under its inherent and wide general powers to provide for public safety and welfare. Our problem concerns the power of Congress and rights of the citizen after a declaration of war, but when active <span class=\"star-pagination\">*305</span> hostilities have ended and demobilization has been completed.</p>\n<p>The Government freely admits, since the present cause stands upon motion to dismiss a bill which plainly alleges that the beer in question is non-intoxicating, we must accept that allegation as true and beyond controversy. In <i>United States</i> v. <i>Standard Brewery,</i> decided this day, <i>ante,</i> 210, we rule in effect that for many months prior to the Volstead Act, passed October 28, 1919, no law of the United States forbade the production or sale of non-intoxicating malt liquors. And so the question for decision here distinctly presented, is this \u0097 Did Congress have power on October 28, 1919, directly and instantly to prohibit the sale of a non-intoxicating beverage, theretofore lawfully produced and which until then could have been lawfully vended, without making any provision for compensation to the owner?</p>\n<p>The Federal Government has only those powers granted by the Constitution. The Eighteenth Amendment not having become effective, it has no general power to prohibit the manufacture or sale of liquors. But by positive grant Congress has been empowered: \"To declare war,\" \"to raise and support armies,\" \"to provide and maintain a navy,\" \"to make rules for the government and regulation of the land and naval forces,\" \"to make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into execution the foregoing powers\"; and to these it is attempted to trace the asserted power to prohibit sale of complainant's beer. (See concerning implied powers, Cooley's Principles of Constitutional Law, 105; Story on the Constitution, 4th ed., \u00a7 1243.)</p>\n<p>The argument runs \u0097 This court has held in <i>Hamilton</i> v. <i>Kentucky Distilleries &amp; Warehouse Co., ante,</i> 146, that under a power implied because necessary and proper to carry into execution the above named powers relating to war, in October, 1919, Congress could prohibit the sale <span class=\"star-pagination\">*306</span> of intoxicating liquors. In order to make such a prohibition effective the sale of non-intoxicating beer must be forbidden. Wherefore, from the implied power to prohibit intoxicants the further power to prohibit this non-intoxicant must be implied.</p>\n<p>The query at once arises: If all this be true, why may not the second implied power engender a third under which Congress may forbid the planting of barley or hops, the manufacture of bottles or kegs, etc., etc.? The mischievous consequences of such reasoning were long ago pointed out in <i>Kidd</i> v. <i>Pearson,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"92306\"><a href=\"/opinion/92306/kidd-v-pearson/\"><span class=\"volume\">128</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 21, where, replying to a suggestion that under the expressly granted power to regulate commerce, Congress might control related matters, it was said:</p>\n<p>\"The result would be that Congress would be invested, to the exclusion of the States, with the power to regulate, not only manufactures, but also agriculture, horticulture, stock raising, domestic fisheries, mining \u0097 in short, every branch of human industry. For is there one of them that does not contemplate, more or less clearly, an interstate or foreign market?\"</p>\n<p>For sixty years <i>Ex parte Milligan,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">4</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wall.</span> <span class=\"page\">2</span></span>, 120, 125, has been regarded as a splendid exemplification of the protection which this court must extend in time of war to rights guaranteed by the Constitution, and also as decisive of its power to ascertain whether actual military necessity justifies interference with such rights. The doctrines then clearly \u0097 I may add, courageously \u0097 announced, conflict with the novel and hurtful theory now promulgated. A few pertinent quotations from the opinion will accentuate the gravity of the present ruling.</p>\n<p>\"Time has proven the discernment of our ancestors; for even these provisions, expressed in such plain English words, that it would seem the ingenuity of man could not evade them, are <i>now,</i> after the lapse of more than seventy years, sought to be avoided. Those great and <span class=\"star-pagination\">*307</span> good men foresaw that troublous times would arise, when rulers and people would become restive under restraint, and seek by sharp and decisive measures to accomplish ends deemed just and proper; and that the principles of constitutional liberty would be in peril, unless established by irrepealable law. The history of the world had taught them that what was done in the past might be attempted in the future. The Constitution of the United States is a law for rulers and people, equally in war and in peace, and covers with the shield of its protection all classes of men, at all times, and under all circumstances. No doctrine, involving more pernicious consequences, was ever invented by the wit of man than that any of its provisions can be suspended during any of the great exigencies of government. Such a doctrine leads directly to anarchy or despotism, but the theory of necessity on which it is based is false; for the government, within the Constitution, has all the powers granted to it, which are necessary to preserve its existence; as has been happily proved by the result of the great effort to throw off its just authority.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>* * * * * * * *</h2>\n<p>\"This nation, as experience has proved, cannot always remain at peace, and has no right to expect that it will always have wise and humane rulers, sincerely attached to the principles of the Constitution. Wicked men, ambitious of power, with hatred of liberty and contempt of law, may fill the place once occupied by Washington and Lincoln; and if this right is conceded, and the calamities of war again befall us, the dangers to human liberty are frightful to contemplate. If our fathers had failed to provide for just such a contingency, they would have been false to the trust reposed in them. They knew \u0097 the history of the world told them \u0097 the nation they were founding, be its existence short or long, would be involved in war; how often or how long continued, human foresight could not tell; and that unlimited power, wherever lodged <span class=\"star-pagination\">*308</span> at such a time, was especially hazardous to freemen. For this, and other equally weighty reasons, they secured the inheritance they had fought to maintain, by incorporating in a written constitution the safeguards which <i>time</i> had proved were essential to its preservation. Not one of these safeguards can the President, or Congress, or the Judiciary disturb, except the one concerning the writ of <i>habeas corpus.</i>\"</p>\n<p>By considering the circumstances existing when the War-Time Prohibition Act was challenged, in order to reach the conclusion announced in <i>Hamilton</i> v. <i>Kentucky Distilleries &amp; Warehouse Co., supra</i><i>,</i> this court asserted its right to determine the relationship between such an enactment and the conduct of war; the decision there really turned upon an appreciation of the facts. And that the implied power to enact such a prohibitive statute does not spring from a mere technical state of war but depends upon some existing necessity directly related to actual warfare, was recognized. Treating that opinion as though it asserted the existence of a general power delegated to Congress to prohibit intoxicants, certain cases which declare our inability to interfere with a State in the exercise of its police power (<i>Purity Extract Co.</i> v. <i>Lynch,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"97707\"><a href=\"/opinion/97707/purity-extract-tonic-co-v-lynch/\"><span class=\"volume\">226</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">192</span></a></span>; <i>Silz</i> v. <i>Hesterberg,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"96882\"><a href=\"/opinion/96882/new-york-ex-rel-silz-v-hesterberg/\"><span class=\"volume\">211</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">31</span></a></span>, etc.) are now cited, and it is said they afford authority for upholding the challenged statute. But those cases are essentially different from the present one, both as to facts and applicable principles; the power exercised by the States was inherent, ever present, limited only by the Fourteenth Amendment, and there was no arbitrary application of it; the power of Congress recognized in the <i>Hamilton Case,</i> and here relied upon must be inferred from others expressly granted and should be restricted, as it always has been heretofore, to actual necessities consequent upon war. It can only support a measure directly relating to such necessities and only so long as the relationship continues. Whether these <span class=\"star-pagination\">*309</span> essentials existed when a measure was enacted or challenged, presents a question for the courts; and, accordingly, we must come to this ultimate inquiry: \u0097 Can it be truthfully said, in view of the well-known facts existing on October 28, 1919, that general prohibition immediately after that day of the sale of non-intoxicating beer theretofore lawfully manufactured, could afford any direct and appreciable aid in respect of the war declared against Germany and Austria?</p>\n<p>What were the outstanding circumstances? During the nineteen months \u0097 April, 1917, to November, 1918 \u0097 when active hostilities were being carried on, and for almost a year thereafter, Congress found no exigency requiring it to prohibit sales of non-intoxicating beers. The armistice was signed and actual hostilities terminated November 11, 1918. Our military and naval forces, with very few exceptions, had returned and demobilization had been completed. The production of war material and supplies had ceased long before and huge quantities of those on hand had been sold. The President had solemnly declared, \"The war thus comes to an end; for having accepted these terms of armistice, it will be impossible for the German command to renew it.\" Also \u0097 \"That the object of the war is attained.\" \"The quiet of peace and tranquility of settled hopes has descended upon us.\" July 10, 1919, he announced, \"The war ended in November, eight months ago\"; and in a message dated October 27, 1919, he declared that war emergencies which might have called for prohibition \"have been satisfied in the demobilization of the army and navy.\" Food supplies were abundant, and there is no pretense that the enactment under consideration was intended to preserve them. Finally, the statute itself contains no declaration that prohibition of non-intoxicants was regarded as in any way essential to the proper conduct or conclusion of the war or to restoration of peace.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*310</span> Giving consideration to this state of affairs, I can see no reasonable relationship between the war declared in 1917, or the demobilization following (both of which in essence if not by formal announcement terminated before October, 1919) or restoration of peace (whose quiet had already descended upon us) and destruction of the value of complainant's beverage, solemnly admitted in this record to be non-intoxicating and which it manufactured, held and desired to sell in strict compliance with the laws of New York. Nor can I discover any substantial ground for holding that such destruction could probably aid in an appreciable way the enforcement of any prohibition law then within the competency of Congress to enact. It is not enough merely to assert such a probability; it must arise from the facts.</p>\n<p>Moreover, well settled rights of the individual in harmless property and powers carefully reserved to the States, ought not to be abridged or destroyed by mere argumentation based upon supposed analogies. The Constitution should be interpreted in view of the spirit which pervades it and always with a steadfast purpose to give complete effect to every part according to the true intendment \u0097 none should suffer emasculation by any strained or unnatural construction. And these solemn words we may neither forget nor ignore \u0097 \"Nor shall any person . . . be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation.\" \"The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.\"</p>\n<p>MR.

It goes without saying, I think, that if a law merely prohibits intoxicating liquors and leaves to the jury in each case, from the evidence produced, to determine whether the liquor in question is, in fact, intoxicating or not, its efficient and uniform administration will be impossible. The term `intoxicating' is too indefinite and uncertain to produce anything like uniform results in such trials. Of course, there are certain liquors so generally known to be intoxicating that any court would take judicial notice of this fact. But in the absence of a definition by Congress there will be innumerable beverages as to which the claim will be made that they do not contain enough alcohol to render them intoxicating. These contentions will produce endless confusion and uncertainty. These, I think, are substantially the reasons why Congress should itself provide a definition.</p>\n<p>\"The importance of this matter has been very much emphasized by our present efforts to enforce the war prohibition act. The claim is being made that beer containing as much as 2 3/4 per cent. of alcohol is not intoxicating. And if this must be made a question of fact to be decided by each jury, but little in the way of practical results can be expected.

St. 1918, &#167; 3115 1/8 l), a war measure known as the Lever Act, Congress prohibited the use after September 9, 1917, of food materials or feeds in the production of distilled spirits for beverage purposes and authorized the President to limit of prohibit their use in the production of malt or vinous liquors for beverage purposes, so far as he might, from time to time, deem it essential to assure an adequate supply of food, or deem it helpful in promoting the national security or defense. Under the power so conferred the President, by proclamation of December 8, 1917, prohibited the production after January 1, 1918, of any 'malt liquor except ale and porter' containing more than 2.75 per centum of alcohol by weight. By proclamation of September 16, 1918, the prohibition was extended to 'malt liquors, including near beer, for beverage purposes, whether or not such malt liquors contain alcohol'; and by proclamation of March 4, 1919, the prohibition was limited 'to intoxicating malt liquors.' Under section 2 of the act (section 3115 1/8 ee) the duty of enforcing the above provisions was assigned to the Commissioner of Internal Revenue. This act contained no provision prohibiting the sale of intoxicating or other liquors.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On November 21, 1918, the so-called War-Time Prohibition Act (40 Stat. 1045, c. 212) was approved.

After June thirtieth, nineteen hundred and      nineteen, until the conclusion of the present war and      thereafter until the termination of demobilization, the date      of which shall be determined and proclaimed by the President      of the United States, no beer, wine, or other intoxicating      malt or vinous liquor shall be sold for beverage purposes      except for export. * * *' Section 1.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On February 6, 1919, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue ruled (Treasury Decision 2788) that a beverage containing as much as one-half of 1 per centum of alcohol by volume would be regarded as intoxicating within the intent of the Act of November 21, 1918, and that after May 1, 1919, persons would not be permitted to qualify as brewers if the alcoholic content of their product equaled or exceeded that percentage. In so ruling the Commissioner adopted and applied to this prohibitory act the same classification of malt liquors which had been applied in administering the laws concerning the taxation of beer and other similar fermented liquors.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For since 1902 (Treasury Decision 514) fermented liquor containing as much as one-half of 1 per centum of alcohol had been treated as taxable under Revised Statutes, &#167;&#167; 3339 and 3242 (Comp. St. &#167;&#167; 6143, 5965), and this classification was expressly adopted in the War Revenue Act October 3, 1917, c. 63, &#167; 307, 40 Stat. 311 (Comp. St. 1918, &#167; 6144b). The correctness of this construction of the act was promptly and earnestly controverted by the brewers, who insisted that Congress had intended to prohibit the production only of such beer or other malt liquors as were in fact intoxicating. The attempt was then made to remove the doubt by new legislation before May 1, 1919, when the act would by its terms become operative. On February 26 the House Committee on the Judiciary reported favorably an amendment to H.

St. &#167; 1215). The bill alleged that plaintiff, the owner of a brewery and appurtenances, was on October 28, 1919, engaged in the manufacture of a beer containing more than one-half of 1 per centum of alcohol by volume, and less than 2.75 per centum by weight or 3.4 per centum by volume, and had then on hand a large quantity of such beer, and that this beer was not in fact intoxicating. Plaintiff contended (1) that the act of November 21, 1918, had become void or had expired by its own terms before the bill was filed; (2) that its prohibition by its terms was limited to beer which was in fact intoxicating; (3) that the Act of October 28, 1919, title 1, &#167; 1, which purported to extend the prohibition to the manufacture and sale of beer not in fact intoxicating, exceeded the war power of Congress; and that thereby violation of rights guaranteed to plaintiff by the Fifth Amendment was threatened.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This case was heard and decided below with Dryfoos et al. v. Edwards and it was argued here on the same day with that case and Hamilton v. Kentucky Distilleries &amp; Warehouse Co., 251 U. S. 146, 40 Sup. Ct. 106, 64 L. Ed. &#8212;&#8212;, decided December 15, 1919. For the reasons set forth in the opinion in those cases, the Act of November 21, 1918, was and remained valid as against the plaintiff and had not expired. For the same reasons section 1 of title 1 of the Act of October 28, 1919, was not invalid, merely because it was new legislation. But it is insisted that this legislation is nevertheless void as against the plaintiff, because Congress could not, even under its full war powers, prohibit the manufacture and sale of nonintoxicants, and, at all events, could not without making compensation, extend the prohibition to nonintoxicating liquor acquired before the passage of the act. These objections require consideration.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First. May the plaintiff show as a basis for relief that the beer manufactured by it with alcoholic content not greater than 2.75 per centum in weight and 3.4 per centum in volume is not in fact intoxicating? The government insists that the fact alleged is immaterial since the passage of the Volstead Act by which the prohibition of the manufacture and sale is extended to all beer and other malt liquor containing as much as one-half of 1 per centum of alcohol by volume.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If the war power of Congress to effectively prohibit the manufacture and sale of intoxicating liquors in order to promote the nation's efficiency in men, munitions and supplies is as full and complete as the police power of the states to effectively enforce such prohibition in order to promote the health, safety and morals of the community, it is clear that this provision of the Volstead Act is valid and has rendered immaterial the question whether plaintiff's beer is intoxicating. For the legislation and decisions of the highest courts of nearly all of the states establish that it is deemed impossible to effectively enforce either prohibitory laws or other laws merely regulating the manufacture and sale of intoxicating liquors, if liability or inclusion within the law is made to depend upon the issuable fact whether or not a particular liquor made or sold as a beverage is intoxicating. In other words, it clearly appears that a liquor law, to be capable of effective enforcement must, in the opinion of the Legislatures and courts of the several states, be made to apply either to all liquors of the species enumerated, like beer, ale or wine, regardless of the presence or degree of alcoholic content; or if a more general description is used, such as distilled, rectified, spirituous, fermented, malt, or brewed liquors, to all liquors within that general description regardless of alcoholic content;<sup>b</sup> or to such of these liquors as contain a named percentage of alcohol; and often several such standards are combined, so that certain specific and generic liquors are altogether forbidden and such other liquors as contain a given percentage of alcohol.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A test often used to determine whether a beverage is to be deemed intoxicating within the meaning of the liquor law is whether it contains one-half of 1 per cent. of alcohol by volume. A survey of the liquor laws of the states reveals that in sixteen states the test is either a list of enumerated beverages without regard to whether they contain any alcohol or the presence of any alcohol in a beverage, age, regardless of quantity;<sup>c</sup> in eighteen States it is the presence of as much as or more than one-half of 1 per cent. of alcohol;<sup>d</sup> in six states, 1 per cent. of alcohol;<sup>e</sup> in one state, the presence of the 'alcoholic principle';<sup>f</sup> and in two states, 2 per cent. of alcohol.<sup>g</sup> Thus in forty-two of the forty-eight states&#8212;Maryland appears in two classes above&#8212;a malt liquor containing over 2 per cent. of alcohol by weight or volume is deemed, for the purpose of regulation or prohibition, intoxicating as a matter of law. Only one state has adopted a test as high as 2.75 per cent. by weight or 3.4 per cent. by volume.<sup>h</sup> Only two states permit the question of the intoxicating character of an enumerated liquor to be put in issue.<sup>i</sup> In three other states the matter has not been made clear either by decision or legislation.<sup>j</sup> The decisions of the courts as well as the action of the Legislatures make it clear&#8212;or, at least, furnish ground upon which Congress reasonably might conclude&#8212;that a rigid classification of beverages is an essential of either effective regulation or effective prohibition of intoxicating liquors.<sup>k</sup></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Purity Extract Co. v. Lynch, 226 U. S. 192, 33 Sup. Ct. 44, 57 L. Ed. 184, determined that state legislation of this character is valid and set forth with clearness the constitutional ground upon which it rests:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'When a state exerting its recognized authority undertakes to      suppress what it is free to regard as a public evil, it may      adopt such measures having reasonable relation to that end as      it may deem necessary in order to make its action effective. It does not follow that because a      transaction separately considered is innocuous it may not be      included in a prohibition the scope of which is regarded as      essential in the legislative judgment to accomplish a purpose within the admitted power of the government.' 226 U.      S. 201, 33 Sup. Ct. 46, 57 L. Ed. 184. 'It was competent for      the Legislature of Mississippi to recognize the difficulties      besetting the administration of laws aimed at the prevention      of traffic in intoxicants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It prohibited, among other things, the sale of 'malt      liquors.' In thus dealing with a class of beverages which in      general are regarded as intoxicating, it was not bound to      resort to a discrimination with respect to ingredients and      processes of manufacture which, in the en deavor to eliminate innocuous beverages from the      condemnation, would facilitate subterfuges and frauds and      fetter the enforcement of the law. A contrary conclusion      logically pressed would save the nominal power while      preventing its effective exercise.' 226 U. S. 204, 33 Sup.      Ct. 47, 57 L. Ed. 184. 'The state, within the limits its we have stated, must decide upon the      measures that are needful for the protection of its people,      and, having regard to the artifices which are used to promote      the sale of intoxicants under the guise of innocent beverages, it would constitute an unwarrantable departure      from accepted principle to hold that the prohibition of the      sale of all malt liquors, including the beverage in question,      was beyond its reserved power.' 226 U. S. 205, 33 Sup. Ct.      47, 57 L. Ed. 184.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That the federal government would, in attempting to enforce a prohibitory law, be confronted with difficulties similar to those encountered by the states is obvious; and both this experience of the states and the need of the federal government of legislation defining intoxicating liquors as was done in the Volstead Act was clearly set forth in the reports of the House Committee on the Judiciary in reporting the bill to the 65th Congress, 3d Session, Report 1143, February 26, 1919, and to the 66th Congress, 1st Session, Report 91, June 30, 1919. Furthermore, recent experience of the military forces had shown the necessity of fixing a definite alcoholic test for the purpose of administering the limited prohibitory law included in the Selective Service Act of May 18, 1917, c. 15, &#167; 12, 40 Stat. 76, 82 (Comp. St. 1918, &#167; 2019a).<sup>l</sup> And the Attorney General, calling attention specifically to the claim made in respect to the 2.75 per cent. beer, had pointed out to Congress that definition of intoxicating liquor by fixed standards was essential to effective enforcement of the prohibition law.<sup>m</sup> It is therefore clear both that Congress might reasonably have considered some legislative definition of intoxicating liquor to be essential to effective enforcement of prohibition and also that the definition provided by the Volstead Act was not an arbitrary one.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiff's argument is equivalent to saying that the war power of Congress to prohibit the manufacture and sale of intoxicating liquors does not extend to the adoption of such means to this end as in its judgment are necessary to the effective administration of the law. The contention appears to be, that since the power to prohibit the manufacture and sale of intoxicating liquors is not expressly granted to Congress, but is a power implied under section 8 of article 1 of the Constitution, which authorizes Congress 'to make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into execution' powers expressly enumerated, the power to prohibit nonintoxicants would be merely an incident of the power to prohibit intoxicants, and that it cannot be held to exist, because one implied power may not be grafted upon another implied power. This argument is a mere matter of words. The police power of a state over the liquor traffic is not limited to the power to prohibit the sale of intoxicating liquors supported by a separate implied power to prohibit kindred nonintoxicating liquors so far as necessary to make the prohibition of intoxicants effective; it is a single broad power to make such laws, by way of prohibition, as may be required to effectively suppress the traffic in intoxicating liquors. Likewise the implied war power over intoxicating liquors extends to the enactment of laws which will not merely prohibit the sale of intoxicating liquors but will effectually prevent their sale. Furthermore, as stated in Hamilton v. Kentucky Distilleries &amp; Warehouse Co., supra, while discussing the implied power to prohibit the sale of intoxicating liquors:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'When the United States exerts any of the powers conferred      upon it by the Constitution, no valid objection can be based      upon the fact that such exercise may be attended by the same      incidents which attend the exercise by a state of its police      power. * * *'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The distinction sought to be made by plaintiff between the scope or incidents of an express power and those of an implied power has no basis in reason or authority. Thus, the Constitution confers upon Congress the express power 'to establish post offices and post roads.' Article 1, &#167; 8, cl. 7. From this is implied the power to acquire land for post offices in the several states, Battle v. United States, 209 U. S. 36, 28 Sup. Ct. 422, 52 L. Ed. 670; and as an incident of this implied power to acquire land, the further power is implied to take it by right of eminent domain, Kohl v. United States, 91 U. S. 367, 23 L. Ed. 449. Likewise, the Constitution confers by clause 3 the express power 'to regulate commerce * * * among the several states'; but ther is implied for this purpose also the power to grant to individuals franchises to construct and operate railroads from state to state. California v. Pacific Railroad Co., 127 U. S. 1, 39, 8 Sup. Ct. 1073, 32 L. Ed. 150. Incidental to this implied power to construct or authorize the construction of a railroad is the further implied power to regulate the relations of the railroad with its employes, Second Employers' Liability Cases, 223 U. S. 1, 47, 32 Sup. Ct. 169, 56 L. Ed. 327, 38 L. R. A. (N. S.) 44; to require safety appliances upon cars, even when used in intrastate commerce, Southern Railway v. United States, 222 U. S. 20, 32 Sup. Ct. 2, 56 L. Ed. 72; and to regulate freight rates even to the extent of affecting intrastate rates, American Express Co. v. Caldwell, 244 U. S. 617, 37 Sup. Ct. 656, 61 L. Ed. 1352. Whether it be for purposes of national defense, or for the purpose of establishing post offices and post roads, or for the purpose of regulating commerce among the several states, Congress has the power 'to make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into execution' the duty so reposed in the federal government. While this is a government of enumerated powers, it has full attributes of sovereignty within the limits of those powers. In re Debs, 158 U. S. 564, 15 Sup. Ct. 900, 39 L. Ed. 1092. Some confusion of thought might perhaps have been avoided, if, instead of distinguishing between powers by the term 'express and implied,' the term 'specific and general' had been used. For the power conferred by clause 18 of section 8 'to make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into execution' powers specifically enumerated is also an express power. Since Congress has power to increase war efficiency by prohibiting the liquor traffic, no reason appears why it should be denied the power to make its prohibition effective.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second. Does the fact that title 1 of the Volstead Act took effect upon its passage render section 1 invalid as against the plaintiff? Prohibition of the manufacture of malt liquors with alchoholic content of one-half of 1 per cent. or more is permissible only because, in the opinion of Congress, the war emergency demands it. If, in its opinion, the particular emergency demands the immediate discontinuance of the traffic Congress must have the power to require such discontinuance. To limit the power of Congress so that it may require discontinuance only after the lapse of a reasonable time from the passage of the act would seriously restrict it in the exercise of the war powers. Hardship resulting from making an act take effect upon its passage is a frequent incident of permissible legislation; but whether it shall be imposed rests wholly in the discretion of the lawmaking body. That the prohibition of the manufacture of nonintoxicating beer, if permissible at all, may be made to take effect immediately follows necessarily from the principle acted upon in Mugler v. Kansas, 123 U. S. 623, 669, 8 Sup. Ct. 273, 31 L. Ed. 205, since the incidents attending the exercise by Congress of the war power to prohibit the liquor traffic are the same as those that attend the states' prohibition under the police power. In the Mugler Case, also, the breweries were erected at a time when the state did not forbid the manufacture of malt liquors, and there it was alleged that the prohibition, which became effective almost immediately, would reduce the value of one of the breweries by three-fourths and would render the other of little value. Here as there, the loss resulting to the plaintiff from inability to use the property for brewery purposes, is an incident of the peculiar nature of the property and of the war need which, we must assume, demanded that the discontinuance of use be immediate. Plaintiff cannot complain because a discontinuance later would have caused him a smaller loss. This, indeed, appears to be conceded so far as concerns the brewery and appurtenances. The objection on the ground that the prohibition takes effect immediately is confined to the prohibition of the sale of the beer on hand at the time of the passage of the act. But as to that also we cannot say that the action of Congress was unreasonable or arbitrary.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiff contends however that even if immediate prohibition of the sale of its nonintoxicating beer is within the war power, this can be legally effected, only provided compensation is made; and it calls attention to the fact that in Barbour v. Georgia, 249 U. S. 454, 459, 39 Sup. Ct. 316, 63 L. Ed. 704, following some earlier cases, the question was reserved whether, under the police power, the states could prohibit the sale of liquor acquired before the enactment of the statute. It should, however, be noted that, among the judgments affirmed in the Mugler Case, was one for violation of the act by selling beer acquired before its enactment (see 123 U. S. 625, 627, 8 Sup. Ct. 273, 31 L. Ed. 205), and that it was assumed without discussion that the same rule applied to the brewery and its product (123 U. S. 669, 8 Sup. Ct. 273, 31 L. Ed. 205). But we are not required to determine here the limits in this respect of the police power of the states; nor whether the principle is applicable here under which the federal government has been declared to be free from liability to an owner, 'for private property injured or destroyed during war, by the operations of armies in the field, or by measures necessary for their safety and efficiency' (United States v. Pacific Railroad, 120 U. S. 227, 239, 7 Sup. Ct. 490, 495 30 L. Ed. 634); in analogy to that by which states are exempt from liability for the demolition of a house in the path of a conflagration (see Lawton v. Steele, 152 U. S. 132, 136, 14 Sup. Ct. 499, 38 L. Ed. 385); or for garbage of value taken (Reduction Co. v. Sanitary Works, 199 U. S. 306, 26 Sup. Ct. 100, 50 L. Ed. 204; Gardner v. Michigan, 199 U. S. 325, 26 Sup. Ct. 106, 50 L. Ed. 212); or for unwholesome food of value destroyed (North American Storage Co. v. Chicago, 211 U. S. 306, 39 Sup. Ct. 101, 53 L. Ed. 195, 15 Ann. Cas. 276; Adams v. Milwaukee, 228 U. S. 572, 584, 33 Sup. Ct. 610, 57 L. Ed. 971), for the preservation of the public health. Here, as in Hamilton v. Kentucky Distilleries &amp; Warehouse Co., supra, there was no appropriation of private property, but merely a lessening of value due to a permissible restriction imposed upon its use.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is urged that the act is particularly oppressive in respect to the beer on hand, because the plaintiff was engaged in manufacturing and selling a nonintoxicating beverage expressly authorized by the President in his proclamation of December 8, 1917, and prohibited by him later, only when conservation of all the food products of the country became necessary. The facts afford no basis on which to rest the claim of an equity in the plaintiff's favor. The specific permission from the President to manufacture 2.75 per cent. beer was not on the ground that such beer was nonintoxicating; nor was it a declaration by him that this beer was in fact nonintoxicating. The permission extended to all 'ale and porter' which, every one knows, are intoxicating liquors.<sup>n</sup> This permission to make 2.75 per cent. beer was withdrawn December 1, 1918, under proclamation of September 16, 1918; and no permission to manufacture specifically 2.75 per cent. beer was ever thereafter given by the President. His later proclamation (March 4, 1919) merely limited the prohibition of the use of foodstuffs to use in the production of 'intoxicating liquors.' Whether 2.75 per cent. beer was intoxicating was thus left by the President, not only without a decision, but without even an intimation. The statement of plaintiff that the 2.75 per cent. beer on hand was manufactured under permission of the President is wholly unfounded. It was not until July 1, 1919, when the War-Time Prohibition Act became operative in this respect that there was any prohibition of the sale of any liquors. So far as appears, all the beer which the plaintiff had on hand at the time of the passage of the Volstead Act was manufactured by the plaintiff long after the President had ceased to have any authority to forbid or to permit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Decree affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS, with whom concurred Mr. Justice DAY, and Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER, dissenting.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I cannot accept either the conclusion announced by the court or the reasons advanced to uphold it.

Our problem concerns the power of Congress and rights of the citizen after a declaration of war, but when active hostilities have ended and demobilization has been completed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government freely admits, since the present cause stands upon motion to dismiss a bill which plainly alleges that the beer in question is nonintoxicating, we must accept that allegation as true and beyond controversy. In United States v. Standard Brewery, 251 U. S. 210, 40 Sup. Ct. 139, 64 L. Ed. &#8212;&#8212;, decided this day, we rule in effect that for many months prior to the Volstead Act, passed October 28, 1919, no law of the United States forbade the production or sale of nonintoxicating malt liquors. And so the question for decision here distinctly presented, is this: Did Congress have power on October 28, 1919, directly and instantly to prohibit the sale of a nonintoxicating beverage, theretofore lawfully produced and which until then could have been lawfully vended, without making any provision for compensation to the owner?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The federal government has only those powers granted by the Constitution. The Eighteenth Amendment not having become effective, it has no general power to prohibit the manufacture or sale of liquors. But by positive grant Congress has been empowered 'to declare war,' 'to raise and support armies,' 'to provide and maintain a navy,' 'to make rules for the government and regulation of the land and naval forces,' 'to make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into execution the foregoing powers'; and to these it is attempted to trace the asserted power to prohibit sale of complainant's beer. See, concerning implied powers, Cooley's Principles of Constitutional Law, 105; Story on the Constitution (4th Ed.) &#167; 1243.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The argument runs: This court has held in Hamilton, Collector, v. Kentucky Distilleries &amp; Warehouse Co., decided December 8th, that under a power implied because necessary and proper to carry into execution the above named powers relating to war, in October, 1919, Congress could prohibit the sale of intoxicating liquors. In order to make such a prohibition effective the sale of nonintoxicating beer must be forbidden. Wherefore, from the implied power to prohibit intoxicants the further power to prohibit this nonintoxicant must be implied.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The query at once arises: If all this be true, why may not the second implied power engender a third under which Congress may forbid the planting of barley or hops, the manufacture of bottles or kegs, etc. The mischievous consequences of such reasoning were long ago pointed out in Kidd v. Pearson, 128 U. S. 1, 21, 9 Sup. Ct. 6, 10 (32 L. Ed. 346), where, replying to a suggestion that under the expressly granted power to regulate commerce, Congress might control related matters, it was said:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'The result would be that Congress would be invested, to the      exclusion of the states, with the power to regulate, not only      manufactures, but also agriculture, horticulture, stock      raising, domestic fisheries, mining&#8212;in short, every branch of      human industry. For is there one of them that does not      contemplate, more or less clearly, an interstate or foreign      market?'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For sixty years Ex parte Milligan, 4 Wall. 2, 120, 125 (18 L. Ed. 281), has been regarded as a splendid exemplification of the protection which this court must extend in time of war to rights guaranteed by the Constitution, and also as decisive of its power to ascertain whether actual military necessity justifies interference with such rights. The doctrines then clearly&#8212;I may add, courageously&#8212;announced, conflict with the novel and hurtful theory now promulgated. A few pertinent quotations from the opinion will accentuate the gravity of the present ruling:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'Time has proven the discernment of our ancestors; for even      these provisions, expressed in such plain English words, that      it would seem the ingenuity of man could not evade them, are      now, after the lapse of more than seventy years, sought to be      avoided. Those great and good men foresaw that troublous times would arise, when      rulers and people would become restive under restraint, and      seek by sharp and decisive measures to accomplish ends deemed      just and proper; and that the principles of constitutional      liberty would be in peril, unless established by irrepealable      law. The history of the world had taught them that what was      done in the past might be attempted in the future. The      Constitution of the United States is a law for rulers and      people, equally in war and in peace, and covers with the      shield of its protection all classes of men, at all times,      and under all circumstances. No doctrine, involving more      pernicious consequences, was ever invented by the wit of man      than that any of its provisions can be suspended during any      of the great exigencies of government. Such a doctrine leads      directly to anarchy or despotism, but the theory of necessity      on which it is based is false; for the government, within the      Constitution, has all the powers granted to it, which are      necessary to preserve its existence, as has been happily      proved by the result of the great effort to throw off its      just authority. * * *</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'This nation, as experience has proved, cannot always remain      at peace, and has no right to expect that it will always have      wise and humane rulers, sincerely attached to the principles      of the Constitution. Wicked men, ambitious of power, with      hatred of liberty and contempt of law, may fill the place      once occupied by Washington and Lincoln; and if this right is      conceded, and the calamities of war again befall us, the      dangers to human liberty are frightful to contemplate. If our      fathers had failed to provide for just such a contingency,      they would have been false to the trust reposed in them. They      knew&#8212;the history of the world told them&#8212;the nation they were      founding, be its existence short or long, would be involved      in war; how often or how long continued, human foresight      could not tell; and that unlimited power, wherever lodged at such a time, was especially hazardous to freemen. For      this, and other equally weighty reasons, they secured the      inheritance they had fought to maintain, by incorporating in      a written constitution the safeguards which time had proved      were essential to its preservation. Not one of these      safeguards can the President, or Congress, or the judiciary      disturb, except the one concerning the writ of habeas      corpus.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By considering the circumstances existing when the War-Time Prohibition Act was challenged, in order to reach the conclusion announced in Hamilton, Collector, v. Kentucky Distilleries &amp; Warehouse Co., supra, this court asserted its right to determine the relationship between such an enactment and the conduct of war; the decision there really turned upon an appreciation of the facts. And that the implied power to enact such a prohibitive statute does not spring from a mere technical state of war but depends upon some existing necessity directly related to actual warfare, was recognized. Treating that opinion as though it asserted the existence of a general power delegated to Congress to prohibit intoxicants, certain cases which declare our inability to interfere with a state in the exercise of its police power (Purity Extract Co. v. Lynch, 226 U. S. 192, 33 Sup. Ct. 44, 57 L. Ed. 184; Silz v. Hesterberg, 211 U. S. 31, 29 Sup. Ct. 10, 53 L. Ed. 75, etc.) are now cited, and it is said they afford authority for upholding the challenged statute. But those cases are essentially different from the present one, both as to facts and applicable principles; the power exercised by the states was inherent, ever present, limited only by the Fourteenth Amendment, and there was no arbitrary application of it; the power of Congress recognized in Hamilton, Collector, etc., and here relied upon, must be inferred from others expressly granted and should be restricted, as it always has been heretofore, to actual necessities consequent upon war. It can only support a measure directly relating to such necessities and only so long as the relationship continues. Whether these essentials existed when a measure was enacted or challenged, presents a question for the courts; and, accordingly, we must come to this ultimate inquiry: Can it be truthfully said, in view of the well-known facts existing on October 28, 1919, that general prohibition immediately after that day of the sale of nonintoxicating beer theretofore lawfully manufactured, could afford any direct and appreciable aid in respect of the war declared against Germany and Austria?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">What were the outstanding circumstances? During the nineteen months&#8212;April, 1917, to November, 1918&#8212;when active hostilities were being carried on, and for almost a year thereafter, Congress found no exigency requiring it to prohibit sales of nonintoxicating beers. The armistice was signed and actual hostilities terminated November 11, 1918. Our military and naval forces, with very few exceptions, had returned and demobilization had been completed. The production of war material and supplies had ceased long before and huge quantities of those on hand had been sold. The President had solemnly declared:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'The war thus comes to an end; for, having accepted these      terms of armistice, it will be impossible for the German      command to renew it.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">Also:</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'That the object of the war is attained.' 'The quiet of peace      and tranquility of settled hopes has descended upon us.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">July 10, 1919, he announced, 'The war ended in November, eight months ago;' and in a message dated October 27, 1919, he declared that war emergencies which might have called for prohibition 'have been satisfied in the demobilization of the army and navy.' Food supplies were abundant, and there is no pretense that the enactment under consideration was intended to preserve them. Finally, the statute itself contains no declaration that prohibition of nonintoxicants was regarded as in any way essential to the proper conduct or conclusion of the war or to restoration of peace.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Giving consideration to this state of affairs I can see no reasonable relationship between the war declared in 1917, or the demobilization following (both of which in essence, if not by formal announcement, terminated before October, 1919), or restoration of peace (whose quiet had already descended upon us) and destruction of the value of complainant's beverage, solemnly admitted in this record to be nonintoxicating and which it manufactured, held and desired to sell in strict compliance with the laws of New York. Nor can I discover any substantial ground for holding that such destruction could probably aid in an appreciable way the enforcement of any prohibition law then within the competency of Congress to enact. It is not enough merely to assert such a probability; it must arise from the facts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, well settled rights of the individual in harmless property and powers carefully reserved to the states, ought not to be abridged or destroyed by mere argumentation based upon supposed analogies.

The Judge Advocate General, having been applied to for an opinion concerning its administration, advised that: In matters of military inquiry, the War Department regards a beverage that contains 1.4 per cent. of alcohol as intoxicating liquor within the meaning of section 12 of the Selective Service Act of May 18, 1917 (Comp. St. 1918, &#167; 2019a), and the regulations of the President and the Secretary of War made thereunder; whether beverages are intoxicating liquors * * * in prosecution of civilians is a question for the civil courts.

It goes without saying, I think, that if a law merely prohibits intoxicating liquors and leaves to the jury in each case, from the evidence produced, to determine whether the liquor in question is, in fact, intoxicating or not, its efficient and uniform administration will be impossible. The term 'intoxicating' is too indefinite and uncertain to produce anything like uniform results in such trials. Of course, there are certain liquors so generally known to be intoxicating that any court would take judicial notice of this fact. But in the absence of a definition by Congress there will be innumerable beverages as to which the claim will be made that they do not contain enough alcohol to render them intoxicating. These contentions will produce endless confusion and uncertainty. These, I think, are substantially the reasons why Congress should itself provide a definition.</p>\n        <p>'The importance of this matter has been very much emphasized by our present efforts to enforce the War Prohibition Act. The claim is being made that beer containing as much as 2 3/4 per cent. of alcohol is not intoxicating. And if this must be made a question of fact to be decided by each jury, but little in the way of practical results can be expected. I am, however, most earnestly insisting that, in view of the rulings for many years by the Internal Revenue Department, Congress meant when it used the word 'beer' a beverage of the class generally known as beer if it contained as much as one-half of 1 per cent. of alcohol.'
