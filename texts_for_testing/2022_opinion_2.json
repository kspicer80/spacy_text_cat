Hazel C. Blum, Assistant Attorney General, Office\n             of Criminal Appeals, Anchorage, and Treg R.

These factors include, but are not limited to:\n(1) evidentiary and witness issues; (2) the victim’s wishes; (3) resource limitations; and\n(4) relevant circumstances beyond the parties’ control (such as the COVID-19\npandemic).\n                Lastly, we hold that when a trial court rejects a sentencing agreement as\neither too severe or too lenient, the court is required to follow the procedures outlined in\nCriminal Rule 11(e)(3) and to place its reasons for rejecting the sentencing agreement\non the record for the benefit of the parties and any appellate review.\n\n\n   1\n       See Alaska R. Crim. P. 11(e)(1).\n   2\n       See Blakely v. Washington, 542 U.S. 296, 301-02 (2004).\n   3\n        See Alaska R. Crim.

Chaney, 477 P.2d 441, 444 (Alaska 1970).\n\n                                            –2–                                        2732\n\f       Background facts\n              In July 2018, Officers Gary Moore and Aaron Grimes were dispatched to\na residence in Point Hope after receiving a report that Nick A. Frankson was intoxicated\nand may have discharged a firearm. When the officers arrived on the scene, they\nobserved Frankson holding a rifle inside the residence with the door open. The officers\ndrew their guns as Frankson raised the rifle towards Officer Moore. Officer Moore fired\none round at Frankson, who closed the door. A few minutes later, Frankson left the\nresidence and fled on foot. Officer Grimes followed Frankson until he surrendered.\n              Once in the patrol car, Frankson began kicking the car door. Officer\nGrimes opened the doors to prevent damage, and Frankson kicked at Officer Grimes’s\nface. A breath test revealed that Frankson had a blood alcohol content of 0.133 percent.\n              The officers later observed “two spent .223 shell casings near the front\ndoor” of the residence and received a report from a neighbor of shots being fired in the\narea prior to the officers’ arrival. The affidavit accompanying the complaint stated that\n“due to the layout of the neighborhood there is no position in which a gun could be fired\nwithout being in the direction of a building or dwelling.”\n              Frankson was ultimately indicted on one count of second-degree\nmisconduct involving weapons (knowingly discharging a firearm at or in the direction\nof a dwelling)5 and two counts of third-degree assault (recklessly placing another person\nin fear of imminent serious physical injury by means of a dangerous instrument).6\n              The parties then entered into a plea agreement in which Frankson agreed\nto plead guilty to one count of third-degree assault in exchange for dismissal of the other\ncounts. As part of the plea agreement, Frankson agreed to stipulate to three aggravating\n\n\n   5\n       AS 11.61.195(a)(3)(B).\n   6\n       AS 11.41.220(a)(1)(A).\n\n                                           –3–                                        2732\n\ffactors — AS 12.55.155(c)(8) (“defendant’s prior criminal history includes conduct\ninvolving . . . repeated instances of assaultive behavior”); AS 12.55.155(c)(13)\n(“defendant knowingly directed the conduct constituting the offense at . . . [a] law\nenforcement officer”); and AS 12.55.155(c)(19) (“defendant’s prior criminal history\nincludes an adjudication as a delinquent for conduct that would have been a felony if\ncommitted by an adult”).\n              Although Frankson had an extensive prior history of misdemeanor assaults,\nFrankson qualified as a first felony offender and faced a presumptive sentence of 0 to 2\nyears if no aggravating factors applied.7 However, with the aggravators, Frankson could\nbe sentenced up to a maximum of 5 years. The parties agreed upon a sentence of 5 years\nwith 4 years suspended (1 year to serve) as part of their plea agreement.\n              In April 2019, the superior court accepted Frankson’s plea of guilty and\nordered a presentence report, deferring the question of whether it accepted the parties’\nsentence agreement until sentencing.8\n              Prior to sentencing, while on bail release, Frankson was arrested for\nallegedly making homebrew, punching his nephew and another man, and threatening the\ntwo men with a whaling tool. Frankson was charged with five felonies and five\nmisdemeanors: one count of trafficking in liquor without a license or permit in a local\n\n   7\n       See AS 12.55.125(e)(1). The record shows that Frankson was convicted of a felony\noffense in 2006, but the parties agreed that this conviction was outside the statutory look-\nback period for prior felonies and therefore did not serve to increase the presumptive\nsentencing range. See AS 12.55.145 (defining when prior felony convictions can be\nconsidered).\n   8\n       See Alaska R. Crim. P. 11(e)(1) (“If the parties reach a sentencing agreement, the\ncourt shall require disclosure of the agreement in open court at the time the plea is offered.\nOnce the agreement has been disclosed, the court may accept or reject the agreement, or may\ndefer that decision until receipt of a presentence report. If the court accepts the agreement,\nthe court may impose sentence without a presentence investigation.”).\n\n                                            –4–                                          2732\n\foption area,9 four counts of third-degree assault,10 two counts of fourth-degree assault,11\nand three counts of violating his conditions of release.12\n                Frankson was separately charged in a third case with violating conditions\nof release for contacting one of the witnesses from the original weapons misconduct\ncase.13\n                The parties subsequently changed their plea agreement to resolve all three\ncases through a global plea agreement. Under the new agreement, Frankson’s guilty plea\nto the third-degree assault charge in the first case would remain, and he would serve 600\ndays of imprisonment for that conviction. With regard to the second case, Frankson\nagreed to plead guilty to one count of fourth-degree assault and to serve 120 days of\nimprisonment consecutive to the term of imprisonment on the third-degree assault\nconviction, for a total composite sentence of 720 days. In exchange, the State agreed to\ndismiss the remaining counts from the second case and to dismiss the third case in its\nentirety.\n                In January 2020, the superior court accepted Frankson’s guilty pleas and\nset the matter for a sentencing hearing. The court held the sentencing hearing in March\n2020. At the hearing, Officer Moore objected to the plea agreement as too lenient,\nasserting that Frankson was dangerous. The probation officer who authored the\npresentence report also objected to the plea agreement as too lenient.\n\n\n\n   9\n          AS 04.11.010(a).\n   10\n          AS 11.41.220(a)(1)(A), (a)(5).\n   11\n          AS 11.41.230(a)(1).\n   12\n          AS 11.56.757(a).\n   13\n          Id.\n\n                                           –5–                                        2732\n\f             Frankson and the State defended the plea agreement, explaining that all\nthree cases had serious evidentiary issues. The parties also indicated that the grand jury\nindictment in the original weapons misconduct case had been difficult to obtain.\n             The court questioned the parties as to whether the global plea agreement\nincluded the stipulated aggravating factors that had been part of the original agreement.\nFrankson asserted that it did not; the State asserted that it did. The court continued the\nsentencing hearing to allow the parties to submit briefing.\n             The State then filed a notice that it was withdrawing its offer on the ground\nthat there had been no meeting of the minds regarding whether the aggravating factors\napplied. Frankson moved to enforce the plea agreement. The superior court granted\nFrankson’s motion to enforce the plea agreement, finding that the original stipulation to\nthe aggravating factors was not part of the new global plea agreement. However, the\nsuperior court also ruled that it had the authority to sua sponte consider any non-Blakely\naggravators established by the record in evaluating whether to accept or reject the\nsentencing agreement.\n             At the continued sentencing hearing, Frankson argued that the superior\ncourt had no authority to consider any non-Blakely aggravators and that the sentencing\nagreement should therefore be evaluated based on the assumption that the maximum\nsentence Frankson could receive on the third-degree assault charge was 2 years. The\nState disagreed. The State pointed out that there was a non-Blakely aggravator that could\nbe found based on Frankson’s prior misdemeanor assault convictions —\nAS 12.55.155(c)(8) (“defendant’s prior criminal history includes conduct involving . . .\nrepeated instances of assaultive behavior”). And the State argued that the court should\ntherefore evaluate the sentencing agreement based on the 5-year maximum that could\ntheoretically be imposed given the existence of this aggravator.\n\n\n\n                                          –6–                                        2732\n\f              The superior court agreed with the State. The court further reasoned that,\nhaving found the non-Blakely aggravator based on Frankson’s prior convictions, it could\nalso consider the Blakely aggravator under AS 12.55.155(c)(13) — “defendant\nknowingly directed the conduct constituting the offense at . . . [a] law enforcement\nofficer.” The court then announced that it was rejecting the sentencing agreement as too\nlenient in light of these aggravating factors.\n              Frankson petitioned this Court for interlocutory review, arguing that it was\nerror for the superior court to consider a non-Blakely aggravator when evaluating the\nreasonableness of the sentencing agreement given that there was no agreement between\nthe parties regarding that aggravator.\n              We granted the petition and ordered briefing on two questions: (1) whether\na sentencing court may sua sponte consider non-Blakely aggravating factors when\nevaluating a sentencing agreement under Alaska Criminal Rule 11; and (2) whether a\nsentencing court should apply the “clearly mistaken” standard used to review a sentence\non appeal when deciding whether to accept or reject a sentencing agreement.\n\n\n        Background information on Alaska’s presumptive sentencing scheme\n              In order to address the legal questions raised by this case, we must first\nprovide some background information about Alaska’s presumptive sentencing scheme\nand the effect that the United States Supreme Court’s 2004 case Blakely v. Washington\nhad on that scheme.14\n              In 1978, the Alaska legislature enacted a presumptive sentencing scheme\nfor most felony convictions, with the intended purpose of “eliminating disparity in the\nsentencing of similarly situated offenders and making criminal sentencing a predictable,\n\n\n   14\n        Blakely v. Washington, 542 U.S. 296 (2004).\n\n                                           –7–                                       2732\n\finternally consistent process.”15 Under this “relatively inflexible” scheme, a defendant’s\npresumptive felony sentence was determined by (1) the level of the defendant’s offense\nand (2) the defendant’s prior felony convictions.16 Certain felony offenses, such as\nmurder and kidnapping, were placed outside the presumptive sentencing scheme and\ndesignated as “unclassified” felonies.17 The remainder of the felony offenses were\ndivided into three classes (A, B, and C) — with class A felonies being the most serious.18\nDefendants were also classified based on their criminal history, with first felony\noffenders having no prior felony convictions, second felony offenders having one prior\nfelony conviction, and third felony offenders having two or more prior felony\nconvictions.19 Thus, under the scheme, a defendant convicted of a class A felony would\nface a higher presumptive sentence than a defendant convicted of a class B or class C\nfelony. Likewise, a defendant with prior felony convictions would face a higher\n\n\n\n   15\n        Juneby v.

Prior to 1978,\nthe Alaska legislature commissioned a number of studies on sentencing patterns in Alaska.\nThese studies revealed disparities in sentencing based on race and the identity of the judge.\nSee, e.g., Beverly Cutler, Sentencing in Alaska: A Description of the Process and Summary\nof Statistical Data for 1973, at 176 (1975) (concluding that “disparities of such great\nproportion as noted [in this study], especially among racial groups, suggests strongly an\nanomalous influence in the sentencing process that warrants careful follow-up\ninvestigation”); Alaska Judicial Council, Alaska Felony Sentencing Patterns: A Multivariate\nStatistical Analysis (1974-1976), at iii-iv (1977) (finding that the strictness or leniency of the\nindividual sentencing judge was an important determinant of the length of a sentence).\n   16\n        Juneby, 641 P.2d at 830-33.\n   17\n        SLA 1978, ch. 166, §§ 3, 10, 12.\n   18\n        SLA 1978, ch. 166, § 10.\n   19\n        SLA 1978, ch. 166, § 12; see AS 12.55.125.\n\n                                              –8–                                           2732\n\fpresumptive sentence than a defendant convicted of the same offense who did not have\nany prior felony convictions.\n              As originally enacted, Alaska’s presumptive sentencing scheme used\npresumptive terms — i.e., a set term of imprisonment for each defendant based on the\nlevel of offense and the defendant’s prior felony convictions.20 For the most part, the\npresumptive terms were “intended as appropriate for imposition in most cases, without\nsignificant upward or downward adjustment.”21 But the legislature also created statutory\nfactors in aggravation and mitigation that gave the sentencing court the authority to\nimpose additional active or suspended time over the presumptive term or to impose a\nsentence below the presumptive term, as appropriate.22 These statutory aggravating and\n\n\n\n\n   20\n        SLA 1978, ch. 166, § 12. In fact, the 1978 law only created “presumptive terms” for\nsecond and third felony offenders, as courts retained broader discretion for sentencing first\nfelony offenders (except for some serious offenses or when the offender used a firearm or\ncaused serious physical injury). Id.; see Juneby, 641 P.2d at 830-31. However, this\ndistinction is not significant for our purposes and has since been eradicated by later\nlegislation. See, e.g., AS 12.55.125(c)(1).\n   21\n        Juneby, 641 P.2d at 833.\n   22\n        SLA 1978, ch. 166, § 12; see AS 12.55.155 (factors in aggravation and mitigation);\nJuneby, 641 P.2d at 831 (noting that AS 12.55.155 “allows a sentencing judge to adjust a\npresumptive term upward or downward based on a finding of aggravating or mitigating\nfactors”). The legislature also authorized sentencing courts, in extraordinary cases, to refer\na presumptive sentencing case to a three-judge sentencing panel based on a non-statutory\nmitigating or aggravating factor or manifest injustice.

State, 715 P.2d 1174, 1177 (Alaska App. 1986)\n(explaining that the legislature intended AS 12.55.165 to establish two separate bases for\nreferral of a case to a three-judge sentencing panel).\n\n                                            –9–                                          2732\n\fmitigating factors had to be proved by clear and convincing evidence and found by the\njudge.23\n              Trial courts were nevertheless cautioned to take a “measured and restrained\napproach” in adjusting sentences to accommodate aggravating and mitigating factors so\nas to ensure that the overall goal of eliminating disparity and achieving some measure\nof uniformity was maintained.24\n              Alaska Criminal Rule 32.1 governs the procedures for litigating a statutory\naggravator or mitigator to the trial court.25 As a general matter, the State is required to\ngive notice prior to the sentencing hearing of any aggravators it intends to argue at\nsentencing.26 The defendant likewise must give notice of any proposed mitigators prior\nto the sentencing hearing.27 The rule requires the court to then give the parties the\nopportunity to present evidence and arguments regarding the proposed aggravators or\n\n   23\n        SLA 1978, ch. 166, § 12 (creating AS 12.55.155(f)).\n   24\n        Juneby, 641 P.2d at 833 (“Unless the provisions of AS 12.55.155 are adhered to\nstrictly, and unless a measured and restrained approach is taken in the adjustment of\npresumptive sentences for both aggravating and mitigating factors, then the prospect of\nattaining the statutory goal of uniform treatment for similarly situated offenders would\nquickly be eroded, the potential for irrational disparity in sentencing would threaten to\nbecome reality, and the revised code’s carefully fashioned system of escalating penalties for\nrepeat offenders would be rendered utterly ineffective.”).\n   25\n      See also AS 12.55.155(f) (setting forth procedures for both Blakely and non-Blakely\naggravators).\n   26\n        See Alaska R.

State, this Court addressed the question of\nwhether a trial court could sua sponte find a statutory aggravating factor that had not\nbeen raised or argued by the State.30 Hartley involved a defendant who was convicted,\nfollowing a jury trial, of first-degree sexual assault and burglary.31 Hartley proposed\nthree mitigating factors which were rejected by the trial court. The State opposed the\nmitigating factors but did not file notice of any aggravating factors. At sentencing, the\nprosecutor indicated that the State would be satisfied with the presumptive term. The\ntrial court nevertheless sua sponte found an aggravating factor and sentenced Hartley to\na sentence above the presumptive term.32\n               Hartley appealed, arguing that the trial court had no authority to find a\nstatutory aggravating factor that the State had not raised or argued. According to\nHartley, an aggravating factor was akin to a criminal charge, and therefore only the State\nhad the power to decide whether an aggravating factor should apply to a given case.33\n               This Court disagreed that statutory aggravating factors fell within the\nState’s charging authority. Instead, we held that statutory aggravating factors fell within\n\n\n\n   28\n        Alaska R. Crim. P. 32.1(f).\n   29\n        Alaska R. Crim. P. 32.1(f)(2).\n   30\n        Hartley v.

We\ntherefore held that the trial court had the authority to sua sponte alert the parties to\npossible aggravating and mitigating factors present in the record as long as the parties\nwere given an adequate opportunity to argue for or against those factors.36 Because the\nparties had not been given an opportunity to respond to the trial court’s sua sponte\napplication of a statutory aggravating factor in Hartley’s case, we remanded the case to\nthe trial court to provide them with that opportunity.37\n               The Hartley rule that a trial court has the authority to sua sponte consider\nstatutory aggravating and mitigating factors that were not raised by the parties remained\ngood law in Alaska until 2004, when the United States Supreme Court decided Blakely\nv. Washington.38 In Blakely, the Supreme Court held that the Sixth Amendment right to\na jury trial prohibits judges from enhancing maximum sentences based on facts other\nthan those facts decided by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt, conceded by the defendant,\nor based on the defendant’s prior convictions.39\n\n\n\n   34\n        Id.\n   35\n        Id.\n   36\n        Id.\n   37\n        Id.\n   38\n        Blakely v.

State, the distinction\nbetween Blakely and non-Blakely aggravators has significant repercussions for a trial\ncourt’s sentencing authority.47\n               Alexiadis involved a trial court’s rejection of a sentencing agreement in\nwhich the parties agreed that no aggravating factors would be argued.48 The defendant\nin Alexiadis pleaded guilty, pursuant to a partial plea agreement, to a consolidated count\nof second-degree assault for injuring his infant son. As part of the partial plea\nagreement, the defendant agreed not to argue any mitigating factors or to seek referral\nto the three-judge sentencing panel. The State also agreed not to pursue any aggravating\nfactors. Sentencing was otherwise left open to the court. Because the parties agreed that\nno aggravators would apply, the defendant faced a presumptive range of 1 to 3 years.49\n               The superior court rejected the parties’ agreement as too lenient because it\nfound that there were two Blakely aggravators — AS 12.55.155(c)(5) (particularly\nvulnerable victim) and AS 12.55.155(c)(18)(A) (offense committed against a member\nof the same social unit) — that clearly applied and would give the court the authority to\nsentence the defendant to more than 3 years to serve if they had been found.

A memorandum\n        written by the court rules attorney to the supreme court explained that the\n        Criminal Rules Committee viewed this amendment as a “correction” —\n        because under Alaska law, “a judge has no authority to disapprove a charge\n        agreement.”\n\nAlexiadis, 355 P.3d at 573 (citing Supreme Court Order No. 1194 (July 15, 1995) and\nquoting Memorandum to the Alaska Supreme Court from Court Rules Attorney Christine\nJohnson (Aug. 3, 1995)).\n\n                                            – 15 –                                         2732\n\fdecision of whether to pursue a Blakely aggravator was akin to a charging decision over\nwhich the court had no authority.54 We therefore concluded that, just as the trial court\nhad no authority to reject the parties’ charge agreement and force the State to go to trial\non the dismissed charges, the trial court also had no authority to reject the parties’\nagreement that the State would not litigate the Blakely aggravators and force the\nprosecutor to litigate those Blakely aggravators.55 In other words, there was no basis for\nrejecting the agreement as too lenient because the court had no authority to sentence the\ndefendant above the 1 to 3 years sentencing range that otherwise applied to the\nagreement.\n              Our decision in Alexiadis did not directly address the status of non-Blakely\naggravators because the defendant in that case did not have any prior convictions, and\nthere were accordingly no non-Blakely aggravators that could have applied. However,\nin dicta, we suggested that our reasoning in Hartley remained sound as to non-Blakely\naggravators and that a trial court consequently retained the authority to sua sponte\nconsider a non-Blakely aggravator when deciding whether to accept or reject a\nsentencing agreement as too lenient.56\n\n\n        The arguments in the current case\n              On appeal, Frankson agrees that trial courts have the authority to sua sponte\nconsider a non-Blakely aggravator when sentencing a defendant after trial or pursuant\n\n\n   54\n        Alexiadis, 355 P.3d at 573.\n   55\n        Id.\n   56\n       Id. at 572 (“Our reasoning in Hartley remains sound as applied to aggravating factors\nthat do not require a jury trial under Blakely — aggravating factors that are based on the\ndefendant’s prior convictions, or on facts necessarily encompassed by the jury’s verdicts, or\non facts expressly conceded by the defendant.”).\n\n                                           – 16 –                                       2732\n\fto a plea agreement that allows open sentencing. But he argues that trial courts have no\nauthority to consider non-Blakely aggravators when evaluating a “complete” or “closed”\nRule 11 agreement — that is, an agreement where the parties have agreed to a particular\nsentence. According to Frankson, when the parties agree to a sentence within the\npresumptive range, the trial court is bound by the State’s agreement not to pursue any\naggravators, and the court therefore has no authority to consider non-Blakely aggravators\nthat might apply when evaluating whether to accept or reject the agreed-upon sentence.\n               But Frankson’s position is contrary to principles of separation of powers\nand the history of plea bargaining under Alaska law. As we explained in Alexiadis, the\ndistinction between sentencing agreements and charge agreements is grounded in the\nconstitutional separation of powers doctrine.57 As a general matter, the executive branch\nhas the sole authority to decide whether to bring criminal charges and what criminal\ncharges to bring.58 In contrast, sentencing is primarily considered a judicial function,\nsubject to the parameters and guidelines created by the legislature.59\n\n   57\n        Id. at 572-73.\n   58\n        Id.; see also State v.

Instead, the defendant\nmust be given the choice to either withdraw their plea or to move forward with open\nsentencing under the remaining terms of the plea agreement. Likewise, the prosecutor\nmust be given the opportunity to withdraw from the sentencing agreement if the trial\ncourt rejects the agreement as too severe.65\n\n\n   62\n        Alaska R. Crim.

P. 11(e)(3).\n   65\n       The party that has not been prejudiced by the court’s rejection of the sentencing\nagreement is not entitled to withdraw from the agreement. Thus, when the court rejects the\nsentencing agreement as too lenient, the State may not automatically withdraw from the other\nparts of the plea agreement. The defendant is entitled to withdraw their plea under these\ncircumstances, but the State has not been prejudiced if the defendant chooses to maintain\ntheir plea and proceed to open sentencing; the only difference to the State is that the\ndefendant would likely receive a higher sentence than what the State bargained for. In\n                                                                               (continued...)\n\n                                           – 19 –                                       2732\n\f              But in order to properly evaluate the severity or leniency of a sentencing\nagreement, the trial court must know the breadth of its sentencing authority in light of\nthe other parts of the agreement that it has no authority to reject — i.e., in light of the\ncharge agreement and any agreement about Blakely aggravators. In other words, the trial\ncourt must know what sentencing range would apply if the agreed-upon sentence was\nrejected and the parties nevertheless proceeded to open sentencing under the remaining\nterms of the agreement. (The parties also need to know what that sentencing range\nwould be so that they can make an informed decision about whether to withdraw from\nthe plea or proceed to open sentencing if the sentencing agreement is rejected as either\ntoo severe or too lenient.)\n              Prior to Blakely, it was clear that the trial court had the authority to sua\nsponte consider any aggravating factors that might apply when evaluating whether to\nreject a sentencing agreement as too lenient. But post-Blakely, the trial court no longer\nhas the authority to consider those Blakely aggravators that must be tried to a jury and\nfound beyond a reasonable doubt. Instead, as Alexiadis explained, those Blakely\naggravators are now akin to charging decisions over which the trial court has no\nauthority under Alaska law.66\n              Frankson argues that non-Blakely aggravators should be treated the same\nas Blakely aggravators, and a court should therefore not be allowed to consider non-\nBlakely aggravators when evaluating a sentencing agreement in which the parties have\n\n\n   65\n       (...continued)\ncontrast, when a trial court rejects a sentencing agreement as too severe, the State has been\ndeprived of its bargained-for exchange and the entire plea agreement is affected. In that case,\nthe State is entitled to withdraw from the plea agreement as a whole. See Alaska R. Crim.\nP. 11(e)(3).\n   66\n        Alexiadis v. State, 355 P.3d 570, 572-73 (Alaska App. 2015).\n\n                                            – 20 –                                        2732\n\fagreed to a non-aggravated sentence. But Blakely did not affect the trial court’s authority\nto find aggravators that are based on prior convictions, and we perceive no reason why\nthe court’s traditional sentencing authority should be curtailed in this manner.\nAggravating and mitigating factors have historically been treated as sentencing matters,\nand the fact that Blakely aggravators are now more akin to charging decisions does not\nmean that non-Blakely aggravators should be treated differently than they have been\ntreated in the past.\n              We therefore hold that a trial court may consider a non-Blakely aggravator\nwhen evaluating whether to accept or reject a sentencing agreement as too lenient even\nif the parties have specifically agreed to a sentence within the presumptive range and no\naggravators have been raised or argued.67 Accordingly, we find no error in the superior\ncourt’s consideration of an applicable non-Blakely aggravator when evaluating whether\nto accept or reject the agreed-upon sentence in this case. We additionally find no error\nin the superior court’s consideration of a Blakely aggravator once the non-Blakely\naggravator (and the enhanced sentencing range it would authorize) was established.68\n              We now turn to the second question raised by this petition, which is what\nfactors a trial court should consider when deciding whether to accept or reject a\n\n\n\n   67\n       We note, however, that the mere existence of a non-Blakely aggravator does not\nnecessarily mean that a sentence within the presumptive range is too lenient. In order to\nensure the overall legislative goal of eliminating disparity and achieving some measure of\nuniformity in felony sentencing, courts should continue to take a “measured and restrained\napproach” in adjusting sentences to accommodate aggravating and mitigating factors.

The language of Rule 11(e) indicates that the decision to accept or reject a\nsentencing agreement rests in the sound discretion of the trial court: “Once the\n[sentencing] agreement has been disclosed, the court may accept or reject the agreement,\nor may defer that decision until receipt of a presentence report.”69 Thus, for purposes of\nour appellate review, the decision of whether to accept or reject a sentencing agreement\nunder Alaska law rests in the sound discretion of the trial court and, in the absence of\nlegal error, will only be reversed for an abuse of that discretion.70\n\n\n\n\n   69\n        Alaska R.

New York, 404 U.S. 257, 262 (1971) (“A court\nmay reject a plea in exercise of sound judicial discretion.”); State v. Conger, 797 N.W.2d\n341, 348 (Wis. 2010) (“[T]he rejection [of a plea agreement] is reviewed as an exercise of\ndiscretion.”); Hoskins v. Maricle, 150 S.W.3d 1, 24-25 (Ky. 2004) (reviewing trial court’s\nrejection of plea agreement for abuse of discretion); State v. Hunt, 485 A.2d 109, 113-14 (Vt.\n1984) (“While respondent . . . has no right to insist on the acceptance of a plea of guilty, the\ncourt, nevertheless, in the exercise of its discretion, has the power to accept such a plea, if\nit deems it wise to do so. A tendered or offered plea should not be refused without good\nreason but, if refused, must be shown that the court abused its discretion.” (citation omitted)).\n\n                                             – 22 –                                         2732\n\f               But acknowledging that the decision to accept or reject a sentencing\nagreement rests in the sound discretion of the trial court does not provide much guidance\nto trial courts regarding what factors they should consider when making such a decision\nor how much deference, if any, they should show to the parties’ reasons for the\nagreement. This absence of guidance is not unique to Alaska law. The equivalent rule\nin federal law, Federal Criminal Rule 11, likewise fails to provide any guidance\nregarding the criteria that the trial court should use in accepting or rejecting plea\nagreements.71 As Professor LaFave has noted, “Just how much ‘consideration’ should\nbe given to the disposition agreed to by the prosecutor and just how ‘independent’ the\njudge should be in these circumstances is a most difficult issue, seldom addressed in the\ncases.”72\n               In his treatise, Professor LaFave points to a decision from the D.C. Circuit,\nUnited States v. Ammidown, as one of the rare cases that does discuss this issue.73 In\nAmmidown, the court held that a trial judge should not reject a plea bargain unless the\njudge “can say that the action of the prosecuting attorney is such a departure from sound\n\n\n\n\n   71\n       See In re Morgan, 506 F.3d 705, 710 (9th Cir. 2007) (“[N]owhere does [Federal\nCriminal] Rule 11 define the criteria by which a district court should exercise the discretion\nthe rule confers, or explain how a district court should determine whether to accept a plea\nagreement.”); see also State v. Hager, 630 N.W.2d 828, 833-34 (Iowa 2001) (“[T]he\nparameters [of a court’s discretion to refuse or accept a plea bargain] have no clear lines, and\nthere are no established criteria or standards to consider in the exercise of discretion.”); State\nv.

But Ammidown involved\na trial judge’s rejection of a charge agreement — a situation where judges must be\nparticularly careful about not encroaching on the prosecutor’s inherent charging\nauthority — as opposed to a sentencing agreement.75 Ammidown is therefore of little\nvalue to Alaska law where trial courts are not authorized to reject a prosecutor’s charge\nagreement.76 As Professor LaFave acknowledges, trial judges are in a “different\nposition” when evaluating whether to accept or reject the parties’ sentencing agreement\nthan when they are evaluating the prosecutor’s decision to dismiss various charges as\npart of a plea agreement.77\n               Frankson also argues in favor of the adoption of a “clearly mistaken”\nstandard of review for trial courts evaluating whether to accept or reject a sentencing\nagreement. (The State has previously advocated for such a standard, although it does not\ndo so in Frankson’s case.78)\n\n\n   74\n        Ammidown, 497 F.2d at 622.\n   75\n        Id. at 618.\n   76\n       See Alexiadis v.

State, 413 P.3d 1207, 1210-11 (Alaska App. 2018) (noting State’s\nargument that “a trial court’s assessment of whether an agreed-upon sentence is too lenient\nis akin to an appellate court’s assessment of whether a sentence is ‘clearly mistaken’”).\n\n                                           – 24 –                                       2732\n\f                The “clearly mistaken” standard is a deferential standard of review that\nappellate courts use when evaluating whether a sentence that a trial judge has imposed\nis excessive.79 The standard is founded on two concepts: that “reasonable judges,\nconfronted with identical facts, can and will differ on what constitutes an appropriate\nsentence; [and] that society is willing to accept these sentencing discrepancies, so long\nas a judge’s sentencing decision falls within a permissible range of reasonable\nsentences.”80\n                We agree with Frankson that the “clearly mistaken” standard may be\nhelpful in that it reminds trial courts that the question is not necessarily what sentence\nthe trial court would itself impose, but instead whether the sentence is within the\npermissible range of reasonable sentences that a trial court could impose. But we are\nhesitant to approve an appellate standard for use in the trial courts given the different\nfunctions of the courts. We are also not persuaded that the “clearly mistaken” standard\nis the best fit because it does not account for the other factors outside the Chaney criteria\nthat can influence plea bargaining.\n                As the State points out, there are often a number of factors that can\ninfluence plea bargaining, many of which the trial court has only limited knowledge.\nThese factors include, but are not limited to: (1) evidentiary and witness issues; (2) the\nvictim’s wishes; (3) resource limitations; and (4) relevant circumstances beyond the\nparties’ control (such as the COVID-19 pandemic).81 The State argues that trial courts\n\n\n   79\n        McClain v.

Houston v. State,\n648 P.2d 1024, 1027 (Alaska App. 1982) (observing that a full explanation of a sentence\n“contributes to the rationality of the sentence, facilitates the reviewing court’s evaluation of\nthe propriety of the sentence, and fosters public confidence in the criminal justice system”).\n   87\n        Cf. Conger, 797 N.W.2d at 348 (explaining that the appellate court “will sustain a\ncourt’s exercise of discretion if the court: (1) examined the relevant facts; (2) applied a\nproper standard of law; and (3) using a demonstrably rational process, reached a conclusion\nthat a reasonable judge could reach”).\n\n                                            – 27 –                                         2732\n\fit could have been. We note, in particular, that the parties have provided more detail to\nthis Court than they did to the superior court regarding the factors that they considered\nwhen reaching this sentencing agreement. We therefore conclude that a remand is\nappropriate to give the parties an opportunity to more fully explain their reasons for\nentering into the sentencing agreement and for the superior court to evaluate those\nreasons within the framework described here.\n              The second reason for the remand is more procedural. As previously\nexplained, when a trial court rejects a sentencing agreement as too lenient, Criminal\nRule 11(e) requires the court to give the defendant the option to either withdraw his\nguilty plea or go forward with open sentencing. This does not appear to have occurred\nin this case. Instead, the parties appear to have treated the superior court’s rejection of\nthe sentencing agreement as automatically nullifying the entire plea agreement. But\nFrankson should have been given the choice to retain the benefits of the charge\nagreement (over which the superior court had no authority) and proceed to open\nsentencing on his guilty pleas. Thus, if, on remand, the superior court again rejects the\nparties’ sentencing agreement, the trial court should ensure that the procedures under\nRule 11(e) are properly followed.\n\n\n       Conclusion\n              For the reasons explained here, we VACATE the superior court’s ruling\nand REMAND this case to the superior court for further proceedings consistent with this\nopinion.\n\n\n\n\n                                          – 28 –                                      2732\n\f","html":"","html_lawbox":"","html_columbia":"","html_anon_2020":"","xml_harvard":"","html_with_citations":"","extracted_by_ocr":false,"opinions_cited":[]}
